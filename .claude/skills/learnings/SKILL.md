# Project learnings

Rules paid for with real downtime. Each entry: the rule first, the incident that
taught it second. This register is **append-only** — when an incident or
near-miss resolves, add its rule here in the same session, newest first. Keep
entries under ~8 lines; deep detail goes in the incident's memory/RCA and is
linked, not inlined.

## How to add a learning

1. Write the RULE as an imperative a developer can obey while coding.
2. Name the trigger surface (what someone is doing when it applies).
3. One-line incident citation (date, version, blast radius).
4. Reference any enforcing automation (lint, CI gate, workflow) — a learning
   with an enforcer is a fact; one without is a TODO to build the enforcer.

### Normalize missing User-Agent at webhook ingress before AWS WAF (2026-08-21)

**When:** proxying public provider webhooks through the API router to an AWS
WAF-protected origin. Providers may omit `User-Agent`; signatures, not that
informational header, authenticate these requests. AWS Managed Rules reject the
request before the API can verify its signature. Add a relay `User-Agent` only
for POST webhook routes and only when absent. Preserve sender headers elsewhere.
*Incident:* Agency webhooks returned origin `403`; the same body with any
`User-Agent` reached Suna. *Enforcer:* `api-router/worker.test.mjs` covers every
webhook path family, sender-header preservation, and non-webhook exclusion.

### A JWKS is not evidence of how tokens are signed, and publishing a key changes behavior before you promote it (2026-08-21)

**When:** migrating a Supabase project to asymmetric JWT signing keys, or
reasoning about which algorithm any environment actually uses.

Two traps, both hit in one session.

**1. Read the token, never the JWKS.** Dev's `/.well-known/jwks.json` advertised
`ES256` and had since 2025-11-30 — while every token it issued was `HS256`. The
key existed in `standby` and had never been promoted. A whole perf change was
reported as "dev gets the win" on that basis and it was wrong. The only
authoritative check is decoding a real access token header:
`base64url(token.split('.')[0])` -> `{"alg":...,"kid":...}`.

**2. Importing the legacy secret publishes an asymmetric key immediately.**
`POST /config/auth/signing-keys/legacy` looks inert — it only registers the
existing HS256 secret as a key — but it also surfaces a standby ES256 key in
JWKS. That flips every verifier from "JWKS is empty, fall back to the network"
to "I have keys, verify locally", **without anything being promoted**, and it
cannot be undone: a `standby` key may only move to `in_use` or
`previously_used`, so the JWKS cannot be emptied again.

That mattered because `apps/api/src/shared/jwt-verify.ts` implements ES256/RS256
only, selects a key by `kid` and falls through to *first key in the cache* when a
token carries none, and `middleware/auth.ts` treated `unsupported-alg` as a hard
401 rather than an inconclusive result. A legacy token with no `kid` would have
selected the new ES256 key and 401'd on a valid session. It was unreachable only
because GoTrue stamps a `kid` on every token, including projects with an empty
JWKS (verified: `{"alg":"HS256","kid":"IBZFPqpuE0oC+hnZ"}`). Fixed in PR #6698 —
check the algorithm before selecting a key, and route both middlewares through
one `isInconclusiveVerifyFailure` predicate.

**The rules:** (1) verify an environment's signing algorithm from a minted token,
never from JWKS or a docstring; (2) before publishing a key anywhere, read every
verifier that consumes that JWKS and confirm an unknown/foreign algorithm falls
back instead of rejecting; (3) treat the legacy import as a behavior change, not
bookkeeping — it is one-way.

*Near-miss:* no outage. Prod was staged (ES256 `standby`, HS256 `in_use`) and its
tokens never changed. Dev and staging were promoted and verified: pre-rotation
sessions kept returning 200 (the old key moves to `previously_used` and still
verifies) and `service_role`/`anon` keys were unaffected.
*Enforcer:* `apps/api/src/__tests__/unit-jwt-alg-fallback.test.ts` pins the
predicate and the no-`kid` symmetric case. Nothing enforces rule (1) — prose only.


### `git stash` is repo-global — never `pop` from a worktree (2026-08-21)

**When:** any `git stash` / `git stash pop` inside a `pnpm worktree` checkout.
The stash stack belongs to the REPOSITORY, not the worktree, and this repo
carries ~80 entries from other people and other branches. `git stash -u` on a
clean tree creates NOTHING, so a reflexive `stash … ; do work ; stash pop`
pops **someone else's `stash@{0}`** into your tree. To compare against another
ref, use `git worktree add <tmp> <ref>`, `git show <ref>:<path>`, or
`git diff <ref>` — never stash.
*Incident:* proving a CI failure was pre-existing, `git stash -q -u` on a clean
worktree stashed nothing, then `git stash pop` unpacked
`stash@{0}` — "WIP on relay-streaming: streaming substitution kernel", 16 files
/ 1203 insertions of a colleague's parked work — into an unrelated worktree.
A modify/delete conflict is the only reason git RETAINED the entry instead of
dropping it; a clean apply would have silently consumed it and left the work
recoverable only via `git fsck`. Recovered with `git reset --hard HEAD` +
`git clean -fd` after verifying `git stash show --stat 'stash@{0}'` still
listed all 16 files. **No enforcer** — the guard is the habit.

### Entitlement is a property of the subscription, and "has an active subscription" is not "pays us" (2026-08-20)

**When:** writing any rule that decides what an account may DO — the wallet
floor, a renewal grant, a feature gate. Do not read `credit_accounts.tier` or
`billing_model` as the authority. Both are stale by design: `tier` stays `free`
for paying accounts, `billing_model` stays `per_seat` long after cancellation,
and legacy paid tiers grant no monthly credits at all. Resolve from the
subscription Stripe is collecting on.

The trap on the other side, which is why this is one rule and not two: **the
free tier carries a REAL $0 Stripe subscription whose status is `active`** —
226,931 such rows on prod. So "has a paying subscription" alone is not
"is a paying customer" either. A bypass needs BOTH a collecting subscription
AND a plan that is actually paid for. Widening the paid-plan half from
`per_seat`-only to any paid tier is the fix; dropping it is an uncapped
free-tier hole.

*Incident:* a customer paying $40/mo for "Kortix Computer · Pro" could not run
a single turn. Legacy `pro` grants 0 monthly credits, so the wallet sat at $0
and `checkBillingActive`'s one-cent admission hold 402'd every run; the paid
renewal had granted nothing since April (`getMonthlyCredits('pro') === 0`).
36 accounts in that exact shape on prod, 29 of them at a zero balance.
Fixed in PR #6662.

*Method note — the rule that actually caught the second bug:* the free-tier
hole was not found by 7,538 green API tests, by typecheck, or by driving the
real API with a seeded account. It was found by running one read-only
`GROUP BY tier, billing_model, subscription_status` against **production** to
size the affected population. **Before changing a predicate that gates money or
access, count the rows it will newly admit, per class, on prod.** A local
fixture only proves the class you thought to seed.

*Enforcer:* `billing-state.test.ts` sweeps every Stripe status × plan class,
including a free-tier + `active` $0-subscription case modeled on the real prod
row; `per-seat-pricing.test.ts` pins `resolveRenewalGrant` for per-seat,
configured-grant and paid-by-amount branches.

### A URL that carries a credential must never reach a log line (2026-08-20)

**When:** logging any URL you did not build literally on that line —
WebSocket connect URLs, presigned links, proxy targets, redirect targets.
Browser WebSockets cannot send headers, so auth is smuggled in the query
string (`?token=`), which turns "log the URL you are dialing" into "print the
user's session JWT". Log `url.split('?')[0]`, or the origin + path, never the
whole thing. Reconnect backoffs make it worse: one flapping sandbox reprints
the credential every 1-15s for as long as it flaps.
*Incident:* `pty-terminal.tsx` logged the full PTY WebSocket URL from
`getKortixPtyWebSocketUrl`, which appends the live Supabase access token, on
every connect AND every reconnect. The same file already carried a comment
saying never to echo the token-bearing URL into the visible buffer — the rule
existed, the enforcement did not. Found by audit, not by an incident; fixed in
PR #6663. **No enforcer yet** — a lint rule banning bare `wsUrl`/`url`
identifiers as console arguments is the TODO.
### A per-host credential never goes in a client-wide header bag (2026-08-20)

**When:** giving any browser/HTTP client a token that authorises ONE origin —
Playwright `use.extraHTTPHeaders`, an axios/fetch default-headers object, a
`RequestInit` you reuse. These apply to EVERY request the client makes, so the
secret goes to every third party the page touches, and any extra header forces
the cross-origin preflight to list it — which a fixed
`Access-Control-Allow-Headers` then rejects, killing the real request with
`net::ERR_FAILED` (the 204 preflight makes it look like CORS passed). Prefer the
cookie/session form of the credential, scoped to its host; if a header is the
only option, attach it per-request to that origin. **Enforcer:**
`tests/unit/web-ecs-workflow.test.ts` fails if the bypass secret returns to
`extraHTTPHeaders`.

*Incident:* `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET` in `playwright.config.ts`
`extraHTTPHeaders` blocked EVERY browser API call on staging — the same 11 specs
red on every release-gate run (32306385663, 32310893789) — and shipped the
secret to 16 hosts incl. Google/Facebook/DoubleClick, in plaintext inside public
workflow-run trace artifacts. Fixed in PR #6632; secret required rotation.

### A deployed API cannot read the test runner's filesystem (2026-08-20)

**When:** writing any e2e fixture that hands the API a path — `repo_url`, a file
URI, a callback host. It works locally because the API is the same machine, and
fails only against a deployed target, where the origin 5xx arrives laundered as
`503 MAINTENANCE_MODE` and looks like an outage. Branch the fixture on the
target (`src/fixtures/world.ts` and `tests/e2e/helpers/manifest-project.ts` are
the pattern: local bare repo on `local`, provisioned managed-git otherwise).

*Incident:* specs 21/22 pointed staging at `/tmp/ke2e-git-*/remote.git` on the
GitHub runner; trigger writes 502'd and the resource-grants agent list came back
silently EMPTY. PR #6632.

### Rewiring writers and converting their table to a view must be TWO releases (2026-08-19)

**When:** an expand/contract store swap (table -> compatibility view). The
migration applies BEFORE the new image rolls, so old pods run against the view
for the whole build+rollout window — and any of their `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT
(cols)` writers 42P10 for that entire window (INSTEAD OF triggers cannot help;
conflict inference precedes them). Locally it is worse: the shared Supabase DB
is cutover'd the moment the migration runs, and EVERY other worktree still on
pre-cutover code breaks until it merges main.
The rule: **release N rewires every ON CONFLICT writer off the table; release
N+1 converts it to a view.** If they must ship together, size the window
explicitly (dev: minutes; prod: pod drain + build — unacceptable for hot
writers) and schedule the promote accordingly. After cutting over a shared
local DB, tell every other active session to merge main IMMEDIATELY.
*Incident:* RBAC cutover #6594 — dev's grant/invite/SSO-JIT/SCIM upserts
42P10'd from migration-apply until the API rollout landed; every local
worktree session on pre-cutover code broke against the shared DB at once.
*Enforcer:* none — prose only. The promote runbook must carry this check.

### A VALIDATE ships only with a reconciliation the TARGET data has passed (2026-08-19)

**When:** writing `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` for an FK/CHECK added `NOT VALID`.
Zero violating rows on the local DB is not evidence — local data is young.
Long-lived envs hold rows written before the catalog/constraint existed (dev:
`iam_role_actions` rows with retired `project.cr.*`/`trigger.*` actions).
Either probe every target env for violators first, or — better — precede the
VALIDATE with idempotent reconciliation DML in the same migration so it cannot
fail on data the constraint predates. Reconcile by REMAPPING a retired value to
its replacement, never by deleting the row: where the retired action was a
rename/collapse (`project.cr.open` -> `project.gitops.push`), the row is the
whole reason the old name still exists, and deleting it silently strips a
capability from whoever held it — a permission change disguised as a migration
fix. Delete only a value with no replacement (the dead `trigger.*` family). A merged migration that VALIDATE-fails
blocks EVERY deploy of that env; the only sanctioned fix is a checksum-guarded
runtime override (`packages/db/scripts/migration-runtime-overrides.ts`).
*Incident:* RBAC cutover #6594 — `role_permissions_action_permissions_fk`
VALIDATE 23503'd on dev; Deploy Dev blocked ~1h; fixed by the third runtime
override (map `cr.*`→`gitops.*` dedup-aware, purge uncataloged, then VALIDATE).
*Enforcer:* `migration-runtime-overrides.test.ts` pins the override; nothing
yet lints "VALIDATE without reconciliation" — prose only.

### `drizzle-kit generate` reports a TTY prompt as "no schema changes" (2026-08-19)

**When:** running `bun packages/db/scripts/generate.ts <slug>` from any
non-interactive shell (an agent, CI, a piped command).
When a diff contains BOTH a created and a deleted table, drizzle-kit opens an
interactive "created or renamed?" picker. Without a TTY it throws
`Interactive prompts require a TTY terminal`, and the wrapper still prints
`No schema changes detected — kortix.ts matches the snapshot. Nothing generated.`
— the snapshot is NOT written, and `schema-sync` then rubber-stamps a stale one.
The rule: **read the line drizzle-kit itself prints (`No schema changes, nothing
to migrate 😴`), not the wrapper's summary**, and verify
`drizzle/meta/_journal.json`'s tail plus the snapshot `prevId` chain by hand. To
avoid the prompt entirely, split the change into two generate runs — deletions
first, then creations — so neither diff has both sides.
*Near-miss:* the canonical-RBAC cutover; `account_memberships` (created) landed
in the same diff as three dropped tables, and the first run silently produced no
snapshot. Same failure class as the 2026-07-16 forked-snapshot incident
(MIGRATIONS.md "Why drizzle-kit generate needed fixing").

### `ON CONFLICT (cols)` cannot run against a view (2026-08-19)

**When:** replacing a table with a compatibility view (expand/contract), or
adding an INSTEAD OF trigger.
A view has no indexes, so `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (a, b) DO UPDATE` fails at
runtime with `42P10 there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON
CONFLICT specification` — INSTEAD OF triggers do not help, because inference
happens before they run. `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` with NO target does work. A
view with a JOIN is not auto-updatable at all, and a rendered/expression column
is never assignable even on an otherwise auto-updatable view.
The rule: **before turning a table into a view, grep every writer for
`onConflictDoUpdate` / `ON CONFLICT (` on that relation and rewire it first.**
*Near-miss:* the canonical-RBAC cutover — five production write sites on
`project_members` / `project_group_grants` / `iam_resource_grants` / the
`account_members` accept paths would have 500'd on the first grant after deploy.
*Enforcer:* `apps/api/src/__tests__/unit-iam-gate-codemod-pin.test.ts`
("no production module writes a legacy grant table directly").

### A store swap needs the FKs the old store had, or it silently loses a cascade (2026-08-19)

**When:** moving rows from several tables into one canonical table.
`project_members`, `project_group_grants` and `iam_resource_grants` each had
`ON DELETE CASCADE` from `kortix.projects`; the canonical `role_assignments` had
no FK on `scope_id`, so the swap would have made "delete a project" stop
retracting its grants. The legacy `iam_policies` never had that FK either, and
410 of its 413 local rows pointed at deleted projects — orphans nothing could
observe and nothing cleaned up.
The rule: **enumerate every FK and every ON DELETE rule on the tables you are
replacing, and reproduce them on the survivor.** Add the FK `NOT VALID`, purge
the pre-existing violations in a batched `.concurrent.ts`, then `VALIDATE` in a
follow-up file.
*Near-miss:* the canonical-RBAC cutover, caught by diffing `pg_constraint` for
the retired tables before writing the migration.


### A picker that offers a model the runtime does not know is a silent outage; the runtime must learn the set from the API it talks to (2026-08-19)

**When:** adding or changing a managed model (`LLM_GATEWAY_MANAGED_MODELS`,
`@kortix/llm-catalog` MANAGED_MODELS), or touching how the sandbox daemon
builds OpenCode's `kortix` provider (`apps/kortix-sandbox-agent-server/src/opencode.ts`).
The web picker reads the API (`/model-picker`, `/v1/llm/models`); OpenCode in the
guest accepts only the ids in the provider map it BOOTED with, built from the
image-baked `/opt/kortix/llm-catalog.json`. That file is frozen at template-build
time and nothing rebuilds a template for a catalog change, so every managed
model added after the bake is offered by the picker and rejected by the guest
(`ModelNotFound: kortix/<id>`, 2 ms after the user message, before any gateway
call). Rules: (1) the guest must fetch the managed set from the API on EVERY boot
(`GET /models?scope=managed`, ~3 KB) and overlay it — never trust a baked list
for anything deployment-config decides; (2) a boot-path fetch gets its own small
budget and a bundled fallback, and is started in parallel with the clone, never
awaited on the critical path beyond a cap; (3) a catalog "refresh" that can
silently fall back (here 2.5 s/4 s for a 3.3 MB body) is not a refresh — size the
payload to the budget; (4) a `session.error` with no assistant message must be
rendered under the turn that failed, or the user sees nothing at all.
*Incident:* prod 2026-08-19, `grok-4.6` and `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` (added
2026-08-12/13) returned no reply in every session on templates built before
then; 0 gateway log rows ever. PR #6576.
*Enforcer:* `managed-fallback-sync.test.ts` (bundled table vs `MANAGED_MODELS`
drift), `managed-model-overlay.test.ts` (stale file + live overlay; failed
fetch → bundled floor; await cap), `managed-scope.test.ts`; web: sync-store
per-turn `session.error` tests. Not enforced: a live "picker ⊆ guest provider
map" assertion after deploy — run the dev sweep by hand until it exists.

### `KORTIX_SELF_HOST_CONFIG_DIR` isolates the config, NOT the containers (2026-08-19)

**When:** exercising `kortix self-host` locally on a machine that already runs a
self-host instance. Pointing `KORTIX_SELF_HOST_CONFIG_DIR` at a temp directory
looks like a sandbox — `init` writes a fresh `.env` + compose there and touches
nothing else. But `composeProject(instance)` derives the Docker Compose project
name from the INSTANCE NAME alone (`kortix-<instance>`), so any command that
reaches `docker compose` — `env set`, `start`, `update`, `configure` — applies
the temp config to the containers of the REAL instance of the same name.
`env set EMAIL_URL=…` against a temp dir recreated the live instance's
`kortix-api` (×2, from the temp `KORTIX_APP_REPLICAS`) and `supabase-auth` with
the temp instance's secrets.

The rule: when testing self-host CLI commands against a throwaway config dir,
**also pass `--instance <unique-name>`** — that is the only input that moves the
Compose project. Verify with `docker ps --filter name=kortix-<instance>` BEFORE
running anything that restarts services, and prefer `--no-start` plus reading
the rendered `.env`/`docker-compose.yml` when you only need to inspect
derivation.

Recovery: re-apply the real instance's own files —
`docker compose --project-name kortix-<instance> --env-file <real>/.env -f
<real>/docker-compose.yml up -d --no-build` — then prove identity by diffing a
secret from the real `.env` against `docker exec … printenv`, not by health
alone (a container started from foreign config is perfectly healthy).
*Incident:* 2026-08-19 near-miss during the EMAIL_URL work — the local
`kortix-default` instance (16 containers, up 16 h) had 3 containers recreated
with a temp instance's secrets; restored in ~4 min, all 16 healthy after.
*Enforcer:* none — the CLI should either namespace the Compose project by the
config dir or refuse when the resolved project already exists under a different
instance directory. Until then this rule is the only guard.
### A request/response log must never cap what it captures (2026-08-18)

**When:** persisting or rendering a captured request/response body (gateway
traces, debug logs, any "what was actually sent/received" viewer). Do not add
a byte/char cap that silently swaps in `{truncated, bytes, preview}` or a
"...(truncated)" marker — a capped log lies about what happened and there is
no way for the reader to know how much is missing. If two layers each cap
independently (backend storage, then frontend syntax highlighting), the
combination is even harder to notice.
*Incident:* the gateway's `capture()` (256 KiB) and `relayStream`'s response
preview (256 KiB) both truncated request/response bodies before storage, and
the web Logs viewer then ran the residue through Shiki's highlighter, which
separately clamps at 50,000 chars. A 1.66 MB request showed as a
`{bytes, preview}` stub cut a second time. Fixed in #6523: full capture,
uncapped; `HighlightedCode` takes an `unbounded` flag for viewers whose whole
purpose is showing complete content, keeping the clamp elsewhere as a perf
guard for live-streamed re-highlighting.
*Enforcer:* `packages/llm-gateway` handler/streaming tests assert full-length
capture; `shiki-highlighter.test.ts` pins `unbounded` bypassing the clamp.

### A shared connector catalog needs one canonical credential scope (2026-08-18)

**When:** rematerializing a credential-dependent connector catalog. Only the
project-default credential may write project-wide `connectorActions`. Never use
a member-owned or non-default connection credential. Store catalogs per
connection before supporting credential-specific action sets.
*Incident:* Strix found that PR #6507 let a member MCP credential overwrite the
shared project catalog and expose tenant-specific tool metadata before merge.
*Enforcer:* `sync-mcp.test.ts` rejects member and non-default rematerialization.

### Catalog discovery must use execution credentials and fail on upstream errors (2026-08-18)

**When:** materializing a remote connector catalog, especially MCP
`tools/list`. Resolve the same effective connection credential and static
headers used by tool execution, including OAuth refresh. Reject non-2xx,
protocol-error, and malformed responses; persist a safe error instead of an
apparently healthy empty catalog. Re-run discovery after credentials change,
and never include raw or encoded credential material in diagnostics.
*Incident:* Essentia Dev Sage Intacct authenticated successfully and exposed
four MCP tools, while Kortix sent no credential, parsed an empty HTTP 401 body,
and materialized zero actions without an error.
*Enforcer:* `sync-mcp.test.ts`, `unit-connector-call.test.ts`, and
`oauth2.test.ts` cover authenticated discovery, refresh/rematerialization,
HTTP/JSON-RPC failures, and credential redaction.

### A reused speculative resource needs a consumption signal every holder can see (2026-08-17)

**When:** caching a server-side find-or-create resource client-side (the warm
session ready-store; any pre-provisioned handle). `POST /sessions/warm` reuses
ONE still-unused session per user+project, so every tab, browser and device of
that user holds the SAME id — and a per-tab in-memory store then trusts its
held copy for its whole dwell. The moment ANY holder uses the resource, every
other copy silently points at a session with a conversation in it; the next
project-home send navigates there and auto-sends into it. Holding is not
owning: consult a synchronous cross-holder registry at take time (localStorage
is the only sync cross-tab channel), record every take AND every navigation
into a session, and revalidate a held copy on visibility regain (scopes
localStorage cannot cross). Corollary that let it ship: every session e2e flow
`requires: ['daytona']`, so NO warm contract runs in local CI — green local
gates proved nothing about this feature.
*Incident:* 2026-08-17, dev, night before a customer release — home prompts
delivered into previous sessions; newest session missing from the list (list
seed wiped by refetches racing the `/start` marker drop; adoption stamped no
activity or `updated_at`).
*Enforcer:* `warm-session-taken-registry.test.ts` +
`use-warm-project-session.test.ts` (cross-tab takes, navigation consumption,
revalidation); SESS-18 pins `/start` adoption, list order and
`exclude_session_id` — but only at staging gates (daytona-gated locally:
still a gap).

### Active-turn renewal cadence must stay below the shortest provider backstop (2026-08-17)

**When:** changing sandbox maintenance cadence, provider lifecycle timers, or active-turn renewal. Run exact-turn renewal in a separate leader-owned loop capped at 30 seconds. Do not couple it to the five-minute project-maintenance sweep. Scope the fast lane to durable `activeTurn` or `activeTurns` authority only.
*Incident:* Dev Daytona renewed once, then stopped an exact active OpenCode turn 68 seconds later because the next project-maintenance pass was scheduled five minutes later than the one-minute deterministic provider timeout.
*Enforcer:* `active-turn-renewal.test.ts` caps the loop at 30 seconds and requires `activeTurnsOnly`; `sandbox-reaper.test.ts` excludes idle rows from the fast lane; the live provider harness uses a one-minute native timer.

### Every sandbox stop must revoke all persisted turn authority (2026-08-17)

**When:** changing provider webhooks, idle reaping, manual stop, or the shared stopped-state writer. Remove `activeTurn`, `activeTurns`, and `lifecycleStopClaim` in the same transaction that sets `status='stopped'`. Do not rely on the reaper to clear tokens first; a provider-native timer or webhook can win that race.
*Incident:* the one-minute Dev Platinum proof stopped after `deadline_at`, but the provider webhook committed `status='stopped'` with a synthetic unknown `activeTurns` token still present.
*Enforcer:* `sandbox-state-sync.test.ts` requires `applyStoppedState()` to remove every turn-authority key atomically for all stop paths. The live provider harness verifies the stopped row has zero active turns.

### Presigned uploads must suppress runtime-inferred content types (2026-08-17)

**When:** sending a body to a provider-generated signed upload URL. Send the exact signed headers. Set an explicit empty `Content-Type` when the signature omits it. Do not let Bun infer a MIME type from `Bun.file()`.
*Incident:* E2B template uploads returned GCS `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch` because Bun added `application/gzip` to a URL signed with an empty content type. Template creation succeeded, but every new immutable image remained unbuildable.
*Enforcer:* `unit-e2b-bun-upload-patch.test.ts` requires the E2B dependency patch to use `Bun.file()` and an explicit empty `Content-Type` in both bundles. A real E2B template build verifies the signed upload.

### Provider lifecycle renewal must use the provider activity primitive (2026-08-17)

**When:** implementing provider-neutral lifecycle renewal. Use the provider's native activity or deadline API. Do not assume a guest command updates the provider lifecycle clock. Reject renewal unless the provider reports the sandbox as running.
*Incident:* Daytona accepted repeated `true` guest commands while its one-minute native autostop clock continued unchanged. The sandbox stopped 21 seconds before Kortix `deadline_at` during deterministic lifecycle testing.
*Enforcer:* `daytona.test.ts` requires `refreshActivity()`, rejects stopped sandboxes, propagates failures, and bounds a hung refresh. The live provider harness forces a one-minute native timer.

### A persisted user message is not proof that its OpenCode turn is active (2026-08-17)

**When:** changing exact-turn lifecycle probes. Treat a user-only or incomplete assistant message as active only when `/session/status` reports that exact session as `busy` or `retry`. Treat an idle session as terminal. Treat an unreadable or unknown status as unknown and non-renewing.
*Incident:* a native OpenCode prompt persisted its user message but created no assistant message; the exact-message probe returned active for 198 seconds and would have renewed an idle Platinum sandbox indefinitely.
*Enforcer:* `orphaned-turn-finalize.test.ts` covers busy, retry, idle, and unreadable session status.

### A sandbox lifecycle grant requires exact active-turn evidence (2026-08-17)

**When:** changing session prompt delivery, sandbox reaping, or any sandbox provider lifecycle adapter. Persist token-bound `delivering` authority before upstream delivery. Promote only after OpenCode exposes the exact user `messageID`. Renew both `deadline_at` and the provider-native timer only from a fresh exact-turn probe. Treat unknown evidence as non-renewing. Linearize idle stop against prompt delivery with one database claim, and never let renewal wake a stopped sandbox.
*Incident:* long OpenCode image analyses outlived E2B's absolute timeout and provider idle timers; Kortix displayed “Your session will be restored” while the agent still worked.
*Enforcer:* `sandbox-turn-lifecycle.test.ts`, `integration-sandbox-turn-lifecycle.test.ts`, `sandbox-reaper.test.ts`, `initial-turn-lifecycle.test.ts`, and all three provider lifecycle suites.

### A platform-injected principal must never have its authority re-derived from user config (2026-08-13)

**When:** touching code that RE-resolves an already-minted credential —
`remintGrantForAgentSwitch` / `reconcileStoredSessionAgentGrant`
(`apps/api/src/projects/lib/session-token-grant.ts`), which run on EVERY prompt
and every connector call. The `meta` coordinator is injected by
`addPlatformMetaAgent` and appears in no `kortix.yaml`, so resolving it through
the manifest returns "unlisted agent": deny-all on a governed project,
UNRESTRICTED on an ungoverned one. Both are destructive — the deny-all was
WRITTEN over the coordinator's real grant on its first turn, and the null made
the re-mint refuse the turn outright. Branch for the platform-owned principal in
the ONE pure resolver every path shares (`grantFromLoadedAgents`); a special case
at the mint alone is exactly what the re-mint then erases.
Two traps cost hours here. A comment asserting a fast path is not evidence the
fast path exists — `preview.ts:1144` says an ordinary turn "skips the manifest
read entirely" while the callee has no early return at all; read the callee. And
`authorizeV2` returns `super_admin` BEFORE the agent-grant fold, while a personal
account's primary owner has `is_super_admin = true` — so this entire bug class is
invisible on a laptop until you clear that flag.
*Incident:* the meta coordinator could not list or spawn sessions for the account
owner running it; `kortix sessions ls` / `new` 403'd from turn one onward, and
the 403 blamed their role (that misdiagnosis fixed separately in #6443).
*Enforcer:* `apps/api/src/__tests__/unit-meta-agent-grant-resolution.test.ts`
pins resolution for governed / ungoverned / unreadable manifests, the `skip`
re-mint decision, and the old destructive `write` as a regression guard. Nothing
enforces the comment-vs-callee or super-admin traps — those are prose only.

### Anything created per-deploy needs a reaper, and the reaper needs a namespace (2026-08-12)

**When:** adding or reviewing code that creates a named provider-side artifact
— a snapshot, image, template, volume. Ask two questions: *what deletes the
previous one*, and *whose is it*. `ensureMetaSandboxImage` answered neither: it
deleted a snapshot only when its OWN build failed, never when a newer one
superseded it, and its name carried no environment. The meta fingerprint hashes
the agent/CLI/SDK/shared/starter source trees, so it moves on nearly every
commit — one permanent snapshot per deploy, forever.
Namespace the name by `INTERNAL_KORTIX_ENV`: dev, staging and prod share ONE
Daytona organisation (same API key in all four env profiles), so an
un-namespaced reap on dev deletes the image prod boots from. And make the
"is it still in use" lookup fail **closed** — `recentlyBuiltSnapshotNames`
returns an empty set on a DB error, which a reaper reads as "nothing is
protected, delete everything".
Before writing any reaper, find who still reads the thing: the sibling
`kortix-app-*` snapshots look equally abandoned but are the targets of
`POST /apps/{appId}/rollback`, so reaping them on supersession would have
broken rollback. Unbounded-but-needed means bounded retention, not deletion.
*Incident:* the Daytona organisation hit its 200-snapshot quota (226, of which
118 meta at ~8/day). `POST /snapshots` then 400s, which fails every CI run and
every NEW-project build. Existing projects survived only because
`canServeLastKnownGoodRuntime` lets a session-start boot the previous image —
so the visible symptom was "CI is broken", while the quieter one was that
runtime updates silently stopped reaching sandboxes.

### A deployed API is not a deployed daemon (2026-08-12)

**When:** shipping any change to `apps/kortix-sandbox-agent-server`, or turning
on something that depends on one. `/health` reporting your commit proves the API
rolled; it says nothing about the sandbox. The daemon is gzipped into the
snapshot build context (`apps/api/src/snapshots/build-context.ts:185`) and
reaches a session only after that snapshot is rebuilt or agent-swapped
(`snapshots/templates.ts:613`) AND the warm pool has cycled off the old one.
Prove it in the guest, not from the API:
`grep -aoE "<expected literal>" /usr/local/bin/kortix-agent` in a session
created after the deploy — the Bun-compiled binary embeds its source strings.
Sequence any dependent flag flip AFTER that probe passes.
*Incident:* near-miss, same day as the MCP-argv fix below. Deploy Dev went green
and `dev-api` reported `66b6148d`, but two sandboxes created ~15 min later both
still had the pre-fix `"connector"` spelling. Merging the flag that enables the
MCP face on that evidence would have given every session a server whose command
exits 2 — a broken MCP entry where there had been none.

### A cross-process command string needs a test that RUNS it (2026-08-12)

**When:** one component spawns another by a hardcoded argv — the daemon's
OpenCode MCP entry (`apps/kortix-sandbox-agent-server/src/opencode.ts`), an
entrypoint script, a CronJob command. Asserting the literal proves only that
the string is what you just typed. Spawn it and require a real response.
Pinning both sides to the same literal is worse than no test: it makes the
typo look deliberate and survives review. Where the two packages cannot share
a constant (the daemon is standalone by design — hono + zod, no workspace
deps), read the argv from the producer and execute it in the consumer's test
(`apps/cli/src/__tests__/connectors-mcp-handshake.test.ts`).
*Incident:* e868be1d6c renamed the CLI command `executor` → `connectors` but
pointed the daemon at `connector`, singular. Every sandbox got `unknown
command` + exit 2, so the `kortix-connectors` MCP server never started for six
days. Both daemon unit tests were updated to assert the typo and stayed green;
the e2e tests that really spawn the server used the plural and also stayed
green, testing a path production never took. Blast radius was zero only because
`KORTIX_CONNECTORS_MCP_ENABLED` is off everywhere — the flag, not the tests, is
what contained it.

### A per-turn hot path must not contain an unbounded third-party round-trip (2026-08-11)

**When:** adding an `await` to the prompt path — `syncSandboxEnvForPrompt`
(`apps/api/src/projects/lib/sandbox-env-sync.ts`) and everything it calls. The
network-boundary sync ran a FULL provider re-arm before every turn: manifest
resolve, GET/PUT sandbox secrets, `ensureSecret` per binding, then
`waitUntilArmed` at 40 × 250 ms — up to ~10 s, past the proxy budget. One egress
secret therefore broke every agent turn in the project. Arm once at session
start or in the background, bound the wait, and fail soft ONLY where a skipped
call cannot widen access (a boundary value never enters the guest, so the worst
case is a 401 upstream, not a leak). It also ran before `postEnvToDaemon`, so its
failure skipped the ordinary runtime-secret push too.
*Incident:* 2026-08-11 — same session, same sandbox: egress secret active →
`prompt_async` 502 in 5.2 s, disabled → 200 in 1.2 s. Found only when the product
owner said "I cannot test this on dev"; the symptom was a spinner stuck on
"Considering next steps…", naming neither secrets nor the provider.
*Enforcer:* none — build it.

### A deploy workflow must not cancel a build it cannot outrun (2026-08-10)

**When:** setting `concurrency.cancel-in-progress` on any
`.github/workflows/deploy-*`. A workflow-wide group with `true` starves the
SLOWEST surface, because every surface shares the group: a frontend-only push
kills an in-flight multi-arch API build (~23 min) whenever `main` lands faster
than that build takes (~10–20 min by day). Queue instead — GitHub holds one
pending run and cancels the previous pending one, so a burst still collapses to a
single deploy and the newest commit still wins. `true` also lets an unrelated
push kill `migrate-db` mid-migration.
*Incident:* 2026-08-10 — 19 of 30 Deploy Dev runs cancelled, `dev-api` pinned to
`d1ed3589` for 3.5 h with 5 API commits stranded; it landed only once the trunk
went quiet that evening.
*Enforcer:* none — and `deploy-staging` is still `true`, where a cancelled
`migrate-db` would hit `STAGING_DATABASE_URL`. Build the guard.

### One CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY per table at a time (2026-08-10)

**When:** building indexes on a live table (runbooks, .concurrent.ts migrations).
Two concurrent CIC builds on the same table starve each other's
lock-acquisition points — every acquisition 55P03s until one finishes. Build
strictly serially. If a builder's client process dies, its CIC keeps running
SERVER-side, holds ShareUpdateExclusive, and its final commit is unreliable —
find it in `pg_stat_progress_create_index`, `pg_terminate_backend` it, and
`DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY` the INVALID shell before rebuilding (`IF NOT EXISTS`
silently keeps invalid shells).
*Incident:* v0.12.7 audit-v2 index pass — parallel lanes 55P03-thrashed, a
killed lane left an orphaned build that starved the retry run.

### The Vercel prod build must be handed the release version (2026-08-10)

**When:** touching deploy-prod's Vercel deploy or apps/web/next.config version
resolution. The Vercel build (rootDirectory apps/web) cannot reliably read the
repo-root VERSION file, so runtime-config reports "dev" and
frontend-auth-proof's `VERSION === X.Y.Z` check fails. Pass
`--build-env NEXT_PUBLIC_KORTIX_VERSION=<version>` on every prod deploy (the
`deploy-web-vercel` job does); the project env `NEXT_PUBLIC_KORTIX_VERSION` is
a static fallback that goes stale — the build-env override wins.
*Incident:* v0.12.7 frontend served VERSION "dev"; gate exhausted 30 attempts;
fixed by `vercel redeploy` after setting the env.

### An audit reconstruction trigger is only safe with its dedup index (2026-08-10)

**When:** installing triggers that INSERT INTO audit_events with
source_ledger/source_record_id set. The prepare-trigger's duplicate check needs
`idx_audit_events_source_phase`; without it every triggered insert seq-scans
the whole table and times out the OUTER statement — cron trigger dispatch
failed prod-wide for ~80 min. Order in any reconcile: dedup index BEFORE (or
immediately after) trigger install, never "later with the other indexes."
*Incident:* v0.12.7 reconcile installed triggers at 17:56, index landed 19:29.

### Never backfill data inside a single-transaction migration (2026-08-10)

**When:** writing any `.sql` migration under `packages/db/migrations/`.
A plain `.sql` migration runs in ONE transaction, so its `ALTER TABLE`s hold
ACCESS EXCLUSIVE until COMMIT — top-level `UPDATE`/`INSERT INTO`/`DELETE
FROM`/data-modifying `WITH` in the same file turns milliseconds of lock into the
full backfill duration, blocking every writer on the table. Write data moves as
batched, incrementally-committed `.concurrent.ts` passes or a supervised
out-of-band runbook (short-tx DDL → triggers → chunked updates → CONCURRENTLY
indexes → ledger rows).
*Incident:* v0.12.7 promote — `centralized_audit_v2` rewrote 30.5M rows of
`audit_events` under lock; prod down ~30 min.
*Enforcer:* `lint-migrations.ts` backfill-DML guard (`-- backfill-safe:`
sign-off escape hatch; `backfill-grandfathered-migrations.json` snapshot).

### Cost every pending prod migration before promoting (2026-08-10)

**When:** preparing a release/promote.
Ordering-correct is not enough. Diff `kortix_migrations.pgmigrations` on prod
against the promoted tree, and for each pending migration ask what it does at
prod data volume. A tag tree containing a migration file is NOT proof the
migration ran — only the ledger is.
*Incident:* same v0.12.7 outage — the dangerous migration had been "shipped" in
v0.12.6's tag but never applied; nobody costed it before the promote.
*Enforcer:* kortix-release skill Step 3.6 (checklist); this rule is the reason.

### The prod frontend must never deploy before the API serves the release (2026-08-10)

**When:** touching `vercel.json`, `vercel-ignore.sh`, or `deploy-prod.yml`.
A push to `prod` must not auto-deploy kortix.com; the frontend deploys only from
deploy-prod's `deploy-web-vercel` job after `verify-live-version` proves the API
is on the release. A new frontend against an old API calls routes that do not
exist — every project load fails "before we could check your access".
*Incident:* v0.12.7 — Vercel auto-promoted the new frontend while the API stayed
back after its migration failed; second occurrence of the class (v0.10).
*Enforcer:* `deploymentEnabled.prod:false` + `deploy-web-vercel` job, pinned by
`tests/unit/web-ecs-workflow.test.ts`.

### node-pg-migrate checkOrder is index-wise on ledger run order (2026-08-10)

**When:** doing any out-of-band migration apply or ledger surgery.
`checkOrder` compares the ledger's run order (`ORDER BY run_on, id`) position by
position against filename order — appending an older-named migration to the end
of the ledger fails the NEXT migrate even though "everything is applied". Place
reconciled rows' `run_on` so ledger order matches file order.
*Incident:* staging deploy failed post-reconcile until the 7 audit-v2 rows were
re-timestamped before the two later migrations.

### Cancel the CI run before killing its DB backend (2026-08-10)

**When:** a deploy's migration step is wedging prod and you terminate it.
The migrate step (and `withMigrationDeadlockRetry`) retries: killing only the
Postgres backend re-locks the table minutes later. Order: cancel the workflow
run, then `pg_terminate_backend`, then verify no reconnect.
*Incident:* v0.12.7 — first kill was undone by a retry; prod degraded a second
time before the run was cancelled.

### Bot-pushed release PRs and repo Actions approval policy (2026-08-10)

**When:** a required check sits in `action_required`, or changing repo Actions
settings. `fork-pr-contributor-approval: all_external_contributors` holds EVERY
PR workflow whose actor lacks write access — including `github-actions[bot]` on
promote-created release PRs — stalling releases behind a manual approve click.
Keep it at `first_time_contributors` (org default) unless there is a concrete
reason, and never quietly stricter than the org.
*Incident:* v0.12.7 release gate stalled in `action_required`.

### Verify CI assertions against the real artifact format on the CI OS (2026-08-10)

**When:** writing shell assertions in workflows (grep/awk over curl output,
cookie jars, headers). curl's Netscape cookie-jar puts the domain in the FIRST
field with an `#HttpOnly_` prefix — a tab-anchored grep can never match; and GNU
grep -E treats `\t` in single quotes as a literal `t` while macOS grep interprets
it, so a locally-green pattern can be dead on ubuntu runners. Use ANSI-C
quoting (`$'\t'`) and test the exact pattern in an ubuntu container.
*Incident:* staging web verify failed twice on the same one-line assertion.

### A TLS/proxy component is only as correct as the third-party clients that accept it (2026-08-14)

**When:** shipping anything that terminates TLS, mints certificates, or sits in
front of other people's HTTP clients (the in-guest egress shim, any MITM proxy).
Unit tests and a `curl` probe are NOT evidence. Three separate bugs in this one
component passed every in-process test and every curl check, and each was found
only by running a real heterogeneous client in a real guest:

- `git` sends CONNECT, gets a 407, and retries **on the same socket**. Without
  `Content-Length: 0` + `Connection: close` on the challenge the retry vanishes
  and every clone fails, while curl is unaffected because it reconnects.
- Python's OpenSSL refuses a chain whose leaf carries no **Authority Key
  Identifier** (`CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED ... Missing Authority Key
  Identifier`); curl accepts the identical certificate. An AKI also needs a
  **Subject Key Identifier** on the issuer to point at, and node-forge's PARSED
  `subjectKeyIdentifier` is a hex string — feeding it back yields an AKI naming
  an issuer that does not exist and breaks every handshake. Use
  `caCert.generateSubjectKeyIdentifier().getBytes()`.
- `curl` offers `Accept-Encoding: gzip` by default. Any redaction that scans
  response BYTES is silently defeated by a compressed body, so a credential
  echoed back returns intact. Force `identity` on the relayed request.

Run the real clients — `curl`, `python3 -m requests`, `git`, `node fetch` — in a
real sandbox before claiming a proxy works, and assert on what the UPSTREAM
received, not on the absence of an error.
*Incident:* the Daytona network-boundary shim shipped to dev broken for every
Python client; caught by a live probe, not by 27 green tests.

### Bun diverges from Node in three load-bearing ways around raw sockets and TLS (2026-08-14)

**When:** writing socket/TLS code that runs under Bun (the API and the sandbox
daemon both do). Measured, bun 1.3.14 vs node v22.22.0:

- `http.Server.emit('connection', socket)` is a **no-op** — the request event
  never fires and the connection hangs with nothing in any log. Use a real
  loopback listener and pipe into it.
- `SNICallback` **never fires** — the handshake completes against a default
  certificate. Bind one static-cert listener per terminated host instead.
- The `'upgrade'` event fires, but a write from that handler **never reaches the
  client**; Node delivers the same bytes. Destroy the socket rather than trying
  to answer.

All three fail SILENTLY (a hang, or the wrong certificate), never an exception.
*Incident:* each cost a debugging cycle in the egress proxy/shim.

### A path allowlist that gates non-idempotency must list EVERY turn-creating endpoint (2026-08-11)

**When:** touching the sandbox proxy's retry loop, or adding an OpenCode endpoint
that starts an agent turn.
`routes/preview.ts` derived "is this safe to retry?" from
`shouldSyncProjectEnvBeforeProxy`, a predicate named after env sync whose regex
listed only `/session/:id/{message,prompt_async}`. `POST /session/:id/command` —
what every `/` slash-command posts to — matched neither that nor
`isLongTurnCompletionRequest`. One omission silently disabled FOUR independent
safeguards at once: no dedupe claim, retry-on-5xx allowed, retry-on-ambiguous-
timeout allowed, and a 15s connect cap applied to an endpoint that blocks for the
whole turn. `MAX_RETRIES = 3` then re-POSTed the non-idempotent body, so one user
submit ran the agent four times and billed four turns.
**Rules:** (1) a predicate that answers "may I send this twice?" gets its OWN
name and its own list — never reuse one written for a different question, because
adding an endpoint to one concern silently opts it into or out of the other;
(2) any new turn-creating path must be added to `isNonIdempotentSessionWrite`
(`sandbox-proxy/prompt-dedupe.ts`) AND `isLongTurnCompletionRequest`
(`sandbox-proxy/preview-retry-budget.ts`) in the same commit.
**Enforcement:** both predicates are unit-tested per endpoint in
`prompt-dedupe.test.ts` / `preview-retry-budget.test.ts`. Black-box proof: two
identical `/command` POSTs must yield exactly one new user message.
*Incident:* session `9f6b0d87`, one `/webapp` submit recorded as 4 identical user
messages 11.0s / 11.8s / 13.7s apart (attempt timeout + `RETRY_DELAYS_MS`
[250, 1000, 3000]).

### Two proxy layers must agree on which upstream calls legitimately block (2026-08-11)

**When:** changing a timeout in `kortix-sandbox-agent-server/src/proxy.ts` or
`apps/api/src/sandbox-proxy/`, or adding an OpenCode endpoint that withholds
headers until its work completes.
The daemon bounded EVERY proxied header wait at `UPSTREAM_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_MS =
10_000`, reasoning only about SSE (headers arrive fast) and a wedged opencode.
`POST /session/:id/command` emits nothing until the whole turn finishes, so
every command over 10s was aborted and answered `502 {"error":"upstream
unreachable"}` — the banner users saw in chat, on a healthy turn. Its own
comment said the 502 exists so "apps/api's retry+auto-wake loop can act on it
immediately" — and that loop assumed idempotency. **A fail-fast designed to
trigger a retry met a retry loop that assumed it was safe to repeat.** One
`/webapp` submit ran the agent four times, each retry aborting the turn the
previous one started, which is where the "Interrupted" labels came from.
**Rules:** (1) a header-wait timeout is only valid for endpoints that ANSWER
fast — blocking-turn endpoints need their own generous bound
(`isBlockingTurnRequest` / `LONG_TURN_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_MS`); (2) when one layer
fails fast *expecting* another to retry, the retry decision must be written down
in both layers, never inferred; (3) a client must not render a
delivered-then-disconnected prompt as a failed send — the retry it invites is
what aborts the live turn (`delivered-but-disconnected.ts`).
**Enforcement:** `blocking-turn-timeout.test.ts` drives BOTH layers' predicates
with the same inputs and requires identical verdicts (verified falsifiable — it
goes red when either side drifts).
**Deployment trap:** the daemon ships inside the sandbox image, so this fix
reaches only sandboxes created from a NEW snapshot. Existing sessions keep the
10s bound; the web-side classifier is what covers them.
*Incident:* session `9f6b0d87`.

### A control split across API and daemon is only live when BOTH halves are (2026-08-14)

**When:** shipping any security control whose two halves live in `apps/api` and
`apps/kortix-sandbox-agent-server`. The API half goes live the moment Deploy Dev
finishes. The daemon half does NOT: it is baked into the sandbox image, reaches
a guest only through a new meta-snapshot build, and the fingerprint that
triggers that build hashes `apps/kortix-sandbox-agent-server/src`. Until an
image carrying the new daemon exists, the API half is running against old
guests and the control does nothing.

The sandbox egress pin hit this exactly: the API mount was verifiably live
(boot-timeline went 403 → 401 on the same request), but a real exfiltrated-token
attack still SUCCEEDED because the box's baked daemon still sent the wrong
token, so nothing wrote a pin. The identical test passed later, unchanged, once
a sandbox with the new daemon existed.

Two rules:

- **Never conclude "the control does not work" from one post-deploy run.** Prove
  which half is live first. An API-side before/after on the same request is
  cheap and decisive (`403 handler-guard` → `401 middleware`).
- **A control that fails OPEN is the right default while it propagates** — the
  pin allows `unpinned`, so old guests kept working and nothing regressed
  during the lag. A fail-closed control shipped this way is an outage.

Do not read a fast `session_start_timeline.totalMs` as proof of a warm-pool box
either: `KORTIX_WARM_SNAPSHOT_ENABLED` defaults false, and ~2s is also what
creating a container from an ALREADY-BUILT image costs.
*Incident:* the token-binding verification failed twice before the image landed.

### A resource-scaled timeout moves the cliff, it never removes it (2026-08-16)

**When:** sizing any timeout whose budget you are tempted to scale by how big
the work is — prompt bytes, file size, row count, payload length.

The LLM gateway gave a new upstream stream a first-byte budget of
`30_000 + ceil((requestBytes - 64KiB) / 1MiB) * 15_000`, capped at `120_000`.
Four size steps land on `90_000` exactly, so every request body between
3,211,776 and 4,259,840 bytes got a 90-second budget and then died with
`upstream stream probe timeout exceeded (90000ms with no bytes)` on a
completely healthy upstream. Users saw a Claude Fable 5 turn fail identically
on every retry once an analysis step pushed the context past ~3 MiB.

The scaling was the bug, not an insufficient constant. Growing the context
raises the budget linearly but raises the model's prefill + thinking time by
more, so the cliff is reachable at every size — it just relocates. **Scale the
budget and you have chosen which inputs fail, not whether they fail.**

Three rules:

- **A slow dependency is not a broken one.** Reserve timeouts for detecting
  *death*. Where "slow" and "dead" are locally indistinguishable — which is
  always, for a model that is prefilling — the deadline must pick a
  *degradation*, not a failure. Here it became a COMMIT point: the stream is
  handed to the relay, which sends headers and heartbeats while the model
  works. Failing over is what silently downgraded users to a fallback model.
- **A timeout you cannot observe from the outside will fire on healthy work.**
  The transport emitted nothing for the AI SDK's `start` / `start-step` parts,
  so a live prefill was byte-identical to a dead socket. One keep-alive byte at
  stream open is what separates them.
- **Check the edge before raising any budget.** Nothing is written downstream
  while a pre-header probe runs, and the live `kortix.com` zone reports
  `proxy_read_timeout = 125` with `editable: false` (Free plan). Raising the
  probe past ~125s cannot work — Cloudflare 524s first. Measured, not assumed:
  `GET /zones/$ZONE/settings/proxy_read_timeout`.

**Enforcement:** `streaming.test.ts` sweeps request sizes 0–16 MiB and asserts
the resolver returns one constant, so no size can reproduce 90,000 again.
**Dead-telemetry corollary:** when a failure stops being reachable, delete the
metric that counted it. `kortix.probe_timeout` was left pinned to false on
every span — a dashboard built on it looks healthy by construction.
*Incident:* PR #6473, merged `7e8a56badaef80374a189e0e427a08eb06b44697`.

### A user-visible string is a shared resource; file ownership cuts through it (2026-08-18)

**When:** any change that renames a label, error message, remedy or flag name —
especially work split across parallel agents by file ownership.

Renaming the network-boundary flag from "Network boundary without Platinum" to
"Network boundary in-guest shim" touched EIGHT files: the feature-flag registry
(which is what the Feature-flags screen actually renders), two route error
bodies, a provisioning-error remedy, its test, two docs pages and the web
constant. An agent that owned only the web file renamed it there and nowhere
else. Nothing failed — no typecheck, no test, no lint — and the result would
have shipped a UI telling users to turn on a flag by a name the screen never
displays. The one guard that existed was a source-text assertion in a file the
agent did not own, which is what eventually caught a sibling change.

The rule: before renaming any user-visible string, grep the OLD string across
the whole repo (`--include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx' --include='*.md'
--include='*.mdx' --include='*.json'`) and change every hit in ONE commit. Then
grep it again and expect zero. A partial rename is worse than no rename: the old
name at least matched the UI.

Corollary for parallel agents: **file ownership is the wrong boundary for a
shared string.** Assign the whole rename to one agent, or do it yourself after
the fan-out lands. Two other same-shaped catches in the same batch — a test
pinning the exact `networkBoundaryEchoNotice(...)` call site, and one pinning
the exact `sudo -u kortix --` invocation — both lived in files the changing
agent did not own, and both only surfaced in CI. Reproducing CI's own command
locally (`pnpm --filter ./packages/** --filter ./apps/** … test`) found them in
one pass instead of one CI round-trip each.
*Incident:* PR #6511, caught in review before merge; two CI round-trips spent.

### `tests-release`'s own load can knock staging over, then the edge worker hides it as "maintenance" (2026-08-18)

**When:** running `pnpm test -- --target-full` (the `full suite + quality
gates` release gate) shortly after a fresh `main` → `staging` promotion.

Two consecutive attempts of the v0.13.0 release gate failed the same way, not
with flaky test assertions but with real `MAINTENANCE_MODE` 503s: 36
occurrences across a 40-minute window (15:11–15:51) in attempt 1, cascading
into unrelated failures across accounts, billing, admin-console and
sandbox-template journeys. `target-browser-full` finished in 2394.0s and
failed; `target-api-full` (439 flows, 1681 cases) never finished at all before
the 90-minute cap killed the job. `staging-api`'s own `/health` showed
`started_at` 21 minutes after the instability began — i.e. the backend task
itself went unhealthy and ECS replaced it mid-run.

The `MAINTENANCE_MODE` response is not a real maintenance flag — it is
`infra/cloudflare/workers/api-router/worker.mjs`'s `AUTOMATIC_MAINTENANCE`
fallback (`worker.mjs:251-273`): on ANY single fetch failure or 502/503/504
from the real origin, the edge worker rewrites that one response into a
generic "Kortix is temporarily unavailable... maintenance" 503, per request.
It is a reasonable UX choice for real end-user traffic, but it means a genuine
backend capacity problem during a test run is invisible in the log as "backend
overloaded" — it reads as "scheduled maintenance," which sent this
investigation looking for a deploy or a flag before the real cause (a single
staging ECS task under-provisioned for the full release suite's own real
concurrent traffic) was found.

**The rule: don't diagnose `MAINTENANCE_MODE` at face value.** Check whether
`X-Maintenance-Mode: blocking` correlates with the backend's own health/restart
timestamps before assuming an intentional maintenance window — it is far more
likely the edge worker masking a real origin failure. And: running the full
release suite immediately after redeploying the target it tests is a
self-inflicted-outage risk on a single-task environment — the fresh task has no
warm connection pools and no capacity headroom, and the suite's own real load
is enough to tip it over. Give staging-api real headroom (task count/size) for
release runs, or the gate keeps eating its own tail.
*Incident:* v0.13.0 release (PR #6520). Correction 2026-08-19: this entry was
written during attempt 5 of run 32151213430; **no attempt of that run has
passed** (attempts 3–6 and 8–10 failed, 2 and 7 were cancelled). The
maintenance-mode 503s were real but were not the dominant cause of the later
attempts (4 occurrences in attempt 10 vs 36 in attempt 1) — see the next entry.
Capacity fix not yet made — staging still runs this gate at capacity risk.

**Addendum (2026-08-19) — what the capacity audit found, and the durable fix.**
Three facts, none of them visible from the symptom:

- **Staging was smaller than dev.** `environments/staging/main.tf:98-103` ran
  the API at `512/1024`, `desired/min/max = 1/1/3`; dev runs `2/2/6` and carries
  no load. The environment that absorbs the heaviest load in the company had the
  smallest box, and its autoscaling ceiling was 3 × 0.5 vCPU = 1.5 vCPU total.
- **The single task was Spot with `base = 0`** (`modules/ecs-api/main.tf:506`)
  behind `deployment_minimum_healthy_percent = 100` (`:521`). One Spot reclaim
  empties the service and ECS cannot place the replacement until Spot capacity
  returns. Some of the "cascading failures" chased that night may have been
  reclaims, not load — and the edge laundered both into the same 503. **Any Spot
  service whose total unavailability is a real cost needs an on-demand base.**
- **The database tier lives outside Terraform.** The staging DB is hosted
  Supabase (`ujzsbwvurfyeuerxxeaz`), injected as `STAGING_DATABASE_URL`; a
  repo-wide grep for RDS/ElastiCache returns zero hits. The `ci_micro` →
  `ci_medium` resize therefore survives every apply AND is recorded by nothing.
  **A resource no plan can show is a resource only a runbook can hold** —
  `docs/runbooks/staging-sizing.md` now does.

**The Terraform trap this exposed, which generalises past staging:** the ecs-api
service carries `ignore_changes = [task_definition, desired_count]` and the
task-def carries `ignore_changes = [container_definitions]`, by design so CI
image rolls do not fight Terraform. `infra/scripts/ecs-deploy.sh` then renders
each new revision from the service's CURRENT one. So **changing `task_cpu` /
`task_memory` in Terraform registers a revision the service never adopts — the
apply is green and the live task never resizes.** Writing a size into Terraform
is not the same as a task running at that size; verify with
`describe-task-definition` on the service's live revision, never from the plan.
Fixed durably by having `ecs-deploy.sh` take ONLY `cpu`/`memory` from the
family's latest ACTIVE revision (Terraform's, right after an apply; its own
previous one otherwise) and everything else from the service's current revision
— so a resize propagates on the next deploy and is a no-op on every other one.
*Enforcer:* `worker.test.mjs` pins staging >= dev on cpu/memory/min_capacity,
pins `fargate_base_on_demand = 1` on both staging services, and pins the new
module variable's default at `0` so dev/prod strategies cannot move.

### A frontend deploy job that `needs:` an unrelated edge job ships a half-deployed staging, and the release gate then blames the code (2026-08-19)

**When:** `deploy-staging.yml` for `044d99480d` (v0.13.0 candidate),
run 32149212400, 2026-08-18 14:34 UTC.

The job `Wire Cloudflare staging DNS and Worker` failed at
`Deploy staging API router Worker`: Cloudflare returned **403** on
`PUT …/workers/scripts/staging-api-kortix-router` (credential rejected; the
same step passed on 2026-08-12 run 31635834664). Because `deploy-web-vercel`,
`verify` and `promote-staging-channel` all `needs:` that job, they were
**skipped** — while `Apply DB migrations`, `Deploy API + gateway (ECS)` and
`Deploy staging web to ECS` had already succeeded. Staging ended up with the
new API and the OLD Vercel frontend, and nothing failed loudly: the workflow
was red, but the API `/health` reported the right SHA and the release PR kept
re-running `tests-release` against it. Every attempt then lost 15/21 browser
journeys to "heading/control not found" (`Admin overview`, `Billing`,
`Sandbox templates`, `Apps`, `Feature flags`, `Switch workspace`, …) — strings
that all exist on `staging` — plus `LOGIN-2`, which drives `$WEB/cli/authorize`.
Ten attempts and two learnings entries were spent reading those as
capacity/flake before anyone opened the deploy-staging run.

**The rule:** before re-running a release gate, open the *deploy* run for the
`RELEASE_SOURCE_SHA` and confirm every job is green — an API `/health` SHA
match proves the API only. When a gate fails with many "element not found"
browser assertions at once and the API lane is mostly green, suspect a stale
frontend deploy first. Structurally: the Vercel/frontend deploy must not
`needs:` the Cloudflare DNS/Worker job (they are independent), and `verify`
must fail loudly on a frontend/API SHA mismatch instead of being skipped along
with its dependency. And rotate the Cloudflare credential used by
`deploy-staging.yml`; it stopped working between 2026-08-12 and 2026-08-18.
*Incident:* v0.13.0 release (PR #6520), run 32151213430 ×10; frontend deploy
skipped since 2026-08-18 14:34 UTC.


### One OAuth provider per concern; and shape-validating a redirect is not authorizing it (2026-08-18)

**When:** wiring any OAuth/identity flow, reusing an existing provider for a
second purpose, or writing any route that redirects somewhere a caller named.

"Link a GitHub account" died on dev with Supabase's
`{"code":400,"error_code":"validation_failed","msg":"Unsupported provider: provider is not enabled"}`.
Nothing had changed in the code. Linking a GitHub **App installation** to a
Kortix account was minting its identity proof through Supabase's
general-purpose "Sign in with GitHub" **login** provider — so an account/org
feature's uptime hung on a per-Supabase-project dashboard toggle that exists
for unrelated product login and that no IaC in this repo manages. Supabase
never authenticated anyone's org; it was an incidental token-minting detour.
Meanwhile the GitHub App's OWN OAuth client — whose `client_id`/`client_secret`
the manifest flow already captured and stored — sat unread in the codebase.

The rule: **one integration per concern.** Before reusing an auth provider for
a second purpose, ask what a failure of the first purpose does to the second.
If the answer is "takes it down," they must not share. Prefer the credential
the feature already owns over the one that happens to be nearby.

**The expensive part was the replacement, not the diagnosis.** The new route
took a `frontend_origin` query param, signed it into the OAuth state, and had
the callback redirect the exchanged GitHub user token to it. Validation was
`normalizeGitHubFrontendOrigin` — which checks the *shape* (https, or http on
localhost) and NOT that the origin is ours. Every attacker HTTPS origin
passed, so `?frontend_origin=https://attacker.example` exfiltrated a victim's
user-to-server token, replayable against the installation-linking endpoints
(CWE-601, HIGH — found by strix-security in review).

**Shape validation is not authorization.** That sentence is the learning. A
URL being well-formed, https, and parseable says nothing about whether you are
allowed to send a credential to it. An allowlist — or better, no parameter at
all — is the check.

And the near-miss inside the near-miss: an earlier commit in the same PR
"fixed the open redirect" by normalizing that param before an early
`oauth_not_configured` return. That closed the *smaller* hole and left the
primary exfiltration path fully open, while reading like a completed security
fix in the diff and the commit message. **When you fix a redirect bug, enumerate
every branch that emits a Location header and every value that can reach one**
— fixing the branch you happened to be looking at is how a HIGH survives a
"security fix" commit. The final fix deleted the parameter entirely: the state
now carries only `{nonce, exp}` and both routes always land on `frontendUrl()`,
so there is no caller-influenced redirect target left to re-trust later.

Corollaries, all paid for in this same change:

- **Config that lives only in a vendor dashboard will drift and nobody will
  know.** Grep proved no Terraform anywhere manages Supabase Auth providers;
  each environment is hand-toggled. A feature depending on such config has no
  gate that can catch its absence — the first signal is a user hitting a 400.
- **Assert the negative.** The ke2e flow that earned its keep asserts where the
  redirect must NOT go ("never contains the attacker origin"), not which reason
  code came back. A happy-path assertion passes an open redirect; only the
  negative one fails it. It also has to cover every branch separately — the
  unconfigured-OAuth branch needed its own case because which branch fires
  depends on deployment state.
- **A branch no test configuration reaches is untested, however green the run.**
  The open-redirect branch only fires when OAuth is unconfigured; unit tests,
  tsc, lint and hand-run curl (against a *configured* API) were all green on it.
- An App's OAuth callback is `callback_urls` in the manifest, a different field
  from `redirect_url` (post-creation only); and binding new state to
  `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` broke instantly because hosted deployments set
  `KORTIX_GITHUB_APP_STATE_SECRET` and no Supabase JWT secret. Reuse the
  resolver the neighbouring feature already uses rather than a same-shaped one.
*Incident:* dev "Link a GitHub account" down; fixed in PR #6526. Four defects
were introduced and caught inside that one PR — an open redirect, a token
exfiltration (CWE-601), a signing secret unset in this deployment, and a
missing manifest field — none by a static gate.

### A test lane that rewrites tracked files is a concurrent writer; never `git add -A` beside it (2026-08-18)

**When:** committing while any background job runs — especially a publish,
release, codegen, or packaging check.

Every CI job on PR #6526 suddenly failed in setup: API typecheck in 11s,
Frontend build in 20s, all three test workers under 70s, none of them running
a single test. The error was `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE — pnpm-lock.yaml is
not up to date with packages/sdk/package.json`. Local runs stayed green
throughout, because the local tree was fine.

The cause: `pnpm test -- --packages-only` was running in the background while
a commit was made with `git add -A`. That lane's publish check temporarily
rewrites every publishable `package.json` — version to `0.0.0-local-test`,
and it strips fields such as `keywords` — then restores them when it finishes.
The blanket add captured that mutated state mid-run and committed four
packages pinned to `0.0.0-local-test` with no matching lockfile.

The rule: **stage explicit paths, never `git add -A`, when anything else could
be writing the tree.** Treat a test lane that mutates tracked files as a
concurrent writer with the same care as a parallel agent (see
[[shared-worktree-parallel-agent-wipe]] and
[[primary-checkout-may-be-parallel-work]]).

Two diagnostics worth keeping: **a whole-matrix failure in well under the
usual runtime is a setup failure, not a test failure** — read the install step,
not the test output. And **reproduce the exact CI step** (`pnpm install
--frozen-lockfile`) rather than the lane it belongs to; it fails in one second
and names the file.
*Incident:* PR #6526, one full CI cycle lost; caught by reading the install
step after the failure pattern (fast + everything) ruled out the tests.

### `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` under a 5-second `lock_timeout` cannot land on live prod (2026-08-19)

**When:** writing or applying any `.concurrent` migration; responding to a `55P03`
("canceling statement due to lock timeout") during `Apply DB migrations to prod`.

v0.13.0's deploy-prod (run 32248002434) failed its migration job twice, both times
on a `.concurrent` migration that did `set lock_timeout = '5s'` then
`create index concurrently …` — first on `kortix.iam_roles` (6 rows, 80 kB),
then on `kortix.account_tokens` (30k rows). The table size is irrelevant:
`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` has to wait for EVERY transaction in the database
that started before it (it takes a ShareLock on each one's virtual transaction
id), and `lock_timeout` governs that wait. On live prod — audit_events writers
on every request, multi-second session-turn transactions — some transaction
outlives a 5-second budget almost every time, so the CIC is cancelled and leaves
an INVALID index behind, which makes a plain re-run fail with "already exists".
The 2–5 s house value exists to keep DDL from blocking prod; CIC's wait blocks
nobody, so that rationale does not apply to it.

The rule: **in a `.concurrent` migration, set `lock_timeout` long enough for a
live system — 2–3 minutes — and note why in the file.** The one lock a CIC
holds (ShareUpdateExclusive on the table) only excludes other DDL/VACUUM; a long
wait on virtual transaction ids hurts no user.

Recovery when it has already failed (used twice tonight, ~2 min each):
1. `select indexrelname from pg_stat_user_indexes s join pg_index i on
   i.indexrelid=s.indexrelid where not i.indisvalid` — find the INVALID leftover.
2. `drop index concurrently if exists <it>`.
3. Hand-run the migration's exact statements in `psql` with
   `set lock_timeout='180s'; set statement_timeout='30min'`; confirm `indisvalid`.
4. `insert into kortix_migrations.pgmigrations (name, run_on) values ('<file
   basename without extension>', now())` — the ledger must match what is live.
5. `gh run rerun <deploy-prod run> --failed` — the migrate step sees nothing
   pending and the roll proceeds.
Migration files are immutable once merged (CI enforces it), so do not edit the
failing file; fix the template/house rule for the next one.
*Incident:* v0.13.0 deploy-prod run 32248002434, migrations
`20260819015724600_rbac_canonical_indexes.concurrent` and
`20260819015726000_account_tokens_session_id_index.concurrent`; ~30 min of
release delay. Prod also carries four pre-existing INVALID legacy indexes
(`public.idx_messages_*`, old Suna table) that predate this and were left alone.

### A redirect URI, a protocol handshake, and a cached catalog all break silently the first time a third party is real (2026-08-19)

**When:** integrating any third-party OAuth provider or remote MCP server;
building any flow whose success depends on what an external server accepts.

Kortix's generic OAuth2 connector surface passed its unit tests, its ke2e flow,
and a full local run. It had never completed one authorization against a real
provider. Three defects were sitting in it, and each one is invisible until a
third party refuses you.

**1. A redirect URI derived from the request is the wrong origin.** The
authorize route built the callback with
`new URL('/v1/connectors/oauth2/callback', c.req.url)`. Behind the load
balancer the API sees the *internal* origin, so dev emitted
`http://dev-api-ecs-fargate.kortix.com/v1/connectors/oauth2/callback` — plain
http, internal hostname. An authorization server byte-compares `redirect_uri`
against the registered value, so every real authorization would have been
rejected. Locally it looked perfect, because locally `c.req.url` *is* the
public origin. **A value a third party will compare against must come from
configuration (`KORTIX_URL`), never from the incoming request.** The same rule
covers webhook URLs, issuer strings, and audience values. Anything derived from
`req.url` is correct exactly until a proxy is in front of you.

**2. "Optional" in a spec means "mandatory" for some implementations.** MCP's
streamable-HTTP transport describes `initialize` → `notifications/initialized`
→ `Mcp-Session-Id`. Kortix posted a bare `tools/call`, which every *stateless*
server accepts — so it worked against the servers we happened to try. Servers
built on the official MCP SDKs default to **stateful** and answer anything
without a session id with `400 Bad Request: Server not initialized`. Read as a
generic 400, that looks like a malformed request, not a missing handshake.
**When a protocol describes a handshake, implement the handshake, even if your
first three test servers do not need it.** Two details that are easy to get
wrong and are load-bearing: the session cache key must include the
*credential* (or two principals share one server session), and `401`/`403` must
never be treated as a handshake failure and retried — those are credential
problems and belong to the caller untouched.

**3. A credential-dependent cache computed before the credential exists is
poison, and nothing recomputes it.** An MCP tool catalog is fetched *with* the
connector credential. Creating the connector before authorizing it therefore
recorded `status: 'error'`, `last_error: "MCP tools/list failed: HTTP 401"`.
Completing OAuth wrote the token and stopped. The user finished the flow, saw
"connected", and the connector still read **Error** with zero tools — the exact
failure the feature existed to remove, now with a success toast on top of it.
**Whenever a credential starts to exist, re-run everything that failed for want
of it.** Ask of any cache: which inputs can arrive *after* this was computed,
and what re-runs it when they do? Here the repo already had the helper
(`rematerializeCatalogAfterCredentialUpdate`); only the OAuth completion paths
never called it.

The meta-rule tying all three together: **an integration is unverified until it
has completed once against the real third party.** Not a mock, not a fixture,
not a conformant test double — the actual server. All three defects survived a
green suite; all three fell out within minutes of pointing the flow at
`api.read.ai`. Budget for one live end-to-end run before calling any
third-party integration done, and prefer a provider that implements the spec
strictly (dynamic registration, stateful sessions) as the one you test against.

*Incident:* found and fixed while building one-click OAuth 2.1 for MCP
connectors, PR #6579. No production outage — the surface had never been used
against a real provider, which is precisely why all three shipped unnoticed.

## Transcript shape alone may never end a turn — and every turn needs a record, whoever started it

Session/turn truth rules paid for on Essentia, 2026-08-20 (session `d1b74954`:
composer flapped "not running" over a visibly streaming session; a user prompt
delivered mid-turn was silently swallowed; PR #6657):

**1. A verdict that a turn is DEAD must be gated on the runtime's own busy
signal, not inferred from the transcript.** "A newer user message follows it"
and "its latest assistant message is completed" both read as terminal and both
occur mid-turn (prompts forwarded into a live turn; the step boundary while
tools run). The reaper cleared a streaming turn's authority at 12:48:51Z; its
step completed at 12:48:54Z. Rule: no terminal verdict while the root reports
`busy`/`retry`; an unreadable status is `unknown`, never terminal.

**2. Every runtime-initiated turn must be announced to the control plane.**
OpenCode starts turns nobody delivered (synthetic `<pty_exited>` wake-ups).
Anything keyed on "a control-plane prompt opened this turn" — `GET .../turn`,
the deadline grant, Stop — silently misses them. The daemon's `turn_begin`
relay + `adoptRuntimeSandboxTurn` close this; the general rule: when a new way
for work to START appears, audit every consumer of "is work running".

**3. A safety floor that DELETES its own retry state is a one-shot race.** The
orphan-redelivery age floor (30s) was checked once, and losing the check
cleared the record that was the only possible trigger — the user's prompt died
at age 27s. A guard that defers must leave the state it will need standing.

**4. An unnamed lifecycle event breaks every consumer keyed on the name.**
`readRootTurnState` bailed on a trailing user message, so turn-end relays
carried no `turn_message_id`: dedup vanished (double finalizes) and the strand
reconciler lost its key. When an identity read has a "give up" branch, list
what downstream keys on the identity before taking it.

*Automation:* flipped-expectation tests in `orphaned-turn-finalize.test.ts` and
`sandbox-reaper.test.ts` pin the incident timeline; `turn-begin-relay.test.ts`
and `integration-sandbox-turn-lifecycle.test.ts` pin the adoption contract.

## A release pipeline is only as green as its quietest dependency

Rules paid for during the v0.13.1 release-gate campaign, 2026-08-19/20 (the
gate had passed 0 of 18 runs in its history; 13 instrumented staging dry-runs
converted every hidden cause into a named fix; v0.13.1 then shipped through
the genuinely green gate — PRs #6622–#6648, release PR #6654):

**1. A failing job in a `needs:` chain silently freezes every dependent
deploy — probe credentials, and never let a janitor gate the payload.** The
`wire-cloudflare` job's Cloudflare key died on 2026-08-18 (403). Three jobs
`needs:`-depended on it, so every staging WEB deploy was skipped for a week —
the release gate drove an Aug-12 frontend against the current API, and the
resulting browser failures read as product bugs. Fix (#6626, #6639): the
non-essential job is `continue-on-error`, and the deploy step probes each
credential with a cheap authenticated read and uses the first one that works.
Rule: when a job fails REPEATEDLY and everything still "works", find out what
its `needs:` dependents silently stopped doing.

**2. Never replay a non-idempotent POST through an edge-laundered 5xx — the
origin may have committed.** The edge Worker turns any origin 5xx into a
synthetic 503 with no `x-request-id`. The ke2e client retried creates through
it, and the second send collided with the first send's committed row: 10
distinct gate failures reading `409 already exists` were the client fighting
itself (run 32306385663). Fix (#6628): POST is never replayed through an
ambiguous 5xx; bounded retries stay for reads; world-bootstrap creates retry
only with per-attempt-fresh identities (#6636, attempt-scoped run ids #6638).
*Automation:* `tests/unit/create-replay-safety.test.ts` injects the exact
laundered 503 and pins POST to one send while GET still retries.

**3. Never put a credential in a browser's global header set.** The Vercel
deployment-protection bypass secret sat in Playwright `use.extraHTTPHeaders`,
which Chromium attaches to EVERY request: it was transmitted to 16 third-party
hosts (Google, Facebook, DoubleClick…) on every run, persisted inside public
workflow trace artifacts, AND its presence in cross-origin preflights made the
API's CORS allow-list reject every browser API call — one line caused both a
credential leak and the entire 11-spec browser failure class (#6632). Fix: the
bypass is exchanged ONCE for a scoped `_vercel_jwt` cookie against the
deployment origin. Rule: scope every credential to the one origin that needs
it; treat `extraHTTPHeaders`/default-header config as a broadcast channel.

*Incident:* no production outage — the cost was ~22 hours of release paralysis
and one leaked secret (rotated). The meta-rule: a gate that has NEVER been
green is not protecting anything; each red must convert one hidden cause into
a named, enforced fix until green is the steady state.

## A relay that authenticates with the wrong credential fails silently, forever

Follow-up rule from the same 2026-08-20 turn-truth work (PR #6664), found only
because the merged fix was verified on deployed dev:

**A non-2xx that the caller merely retries-and-gives-up is indistinguishable
from a feature that was never built.** The new `turn_begin` relay used the
daemon's default token chain (`sandboxRelayContext()`), which prefers
`KORTIX_CLI_TOKEN` — a user/agent PAT — while the route it calls is
sandbox-identity-only. Every relay 403'd, twice, then gave up. On dev the
symptoms were a perfect alibi: opencode emitted the frames, the deployed
binary carried the new symbols, the env was complete, the root check passed,
and a hand-made POST with the sandbox credential returned
`{ok:true,outcome:'adopted'}` — while the ledger held zero rows. This is the
same failure class as the Essentia turn-end 403s that `r4.ts`'s kind-gate
comment already records; the sibling relay (`relayInitialTurnAcceptedToApi`)
had already established the correct pattern.

**Rules.**
1. When adding a sandbox→API relay, copy the CREDENTIAL choice from the
   nearest sibling of the same kind class, not the generic context helper.
   Sandbox-identity kinds (`turn_accepted`, `turn_abandoned`, `turn_begin`)
   resolve `KORTIX_SANDBOX_TOKEN || KORTIX_TOKEN` explicitly.
2. Never relay a credential you know the route will refuse — skip instead. A
   guaranteed 403 loop is worse than an absent feature: it looks like traffic.
3. **Test the wire, not the call count.** The tests that shipped this asserted
   "a POST happened" against a stubbed server. The test that catches it asserts
   the `Authorization` header. Any test that stubs HTTP must assert the
   credential and the URL, or it is only testing itself.
4. Pin the EVENT WIRING separately from the handler's behavior. A unit test
   that calls the relay directly proves nothing about whether the event that
   should trigger it is dispatched — capture a real frame from the deployed
   runtime and feed it through the real dispatcher.

*Incident:* no outage — the fix was simply inert in production for ~25 minutes
between merge and detection, which is exactly what dev verification is for.

## "Positive" is only half of what DER asks of an INTEGER — it must also be minimal

Found 2026-08-21 while chasing a ~4% flake in
`apps/kortix-sandbox-agent-server/src/egress-shim/shim.test.ts`, which turned
out to be a latent production defect in the egress shim's certificate authority
(`egress-shim/ca.ts`).

The serial number was built as `'00' + randomBytes(16)`, with a comment
explaining the leading zero: a first byte `>= 0x80` is read as two's-complement
NEGATIVE and the certificate is rejected. That is true, and it is not
sufficient. **DER requires an INTEGER to be minimal as well as correctly
signed: a `0x00` prefix is legal only when the byte after it is `>= 0x80`.**
When the first random byte came in below that, the zero was redundant and the
certificate was malformed — `BoringSSL … ASN.1 … INVALID_INTEGER` on the
handshake, and `openssl x509` unable to load the file at all.

It fired once in ~256 — the odds of `randomBytes()[0] === 0x00`, the case where
even node-forge's own normalization leaves a redundant zero behind. Every
sandbox mints its own CA and a leaf per terminated host, so roughly one sandbox
in 256 got an egress CA no client could parse, and every HTTPS call the agent
made through the shim failed.

**Rules.**
1. When hand-encoding an ASN.1 INTEGER, satisfy BOTH rules or neither is
   satisfied. Clamping a random leading byte into `0x01..0x7f` answers both by
   construction — never `>= 0x80` so no prefix is needed, never `0x00` so no
   prefix is redundant — at a cost of one bit out of 128.
2. **A 1-in-256 fault sampled probabilistically is a test that passes while the
   bug ships.** Export the encoding rule and pin it directly over the whole
   `0x00..0xff` leading-byte range. The bug survived a suite that minted a
   certificate on every run for months.
3. Filler bytes in a fixture can hide the fault. `00 00 ab …` is VALID (forge
   re-adds a zero `0xab` genuinely needs); `00 00 16 …` is not. Build the
   regression case from the bytes actually captured off the failure, not from a
   convenient repeated byte.
4. `tls.createSecureContext({ cert })` is lenient where `{ ca }` is strict — a
   probe that only passes `cert` will report a malformed certificate as fine.
   Diagnose with `openssl asn1parse`, which names the offending field
   (`prim: INTEGER :BAD INTEGER:[…]`) instead of failing the whole parse.
5. Treat a flaky test in a security-path suite as a defect report until proven
   otherwise. This one was dismissible as "TLS socket timing" for as long as
   nobody read the error text.

*Incident:* no outage reported — the defect was found through CI flake, not
through a customer. Roughly 0.4% of sandboxes would have had non-functional
agent egress with no diagnostic pointing at the CA.

## A browser must never be handed a 5xx for an expected state — an intermediary will replace it

Found 2026-08-20 while shipping per-port preview origins (PR #6681 + follow-ups).
A preview URL whose app had not yet bound its port returned Cloudflare's branded
"Error 502 Bad gateway" page after ~12s. The API was innocent of the *page*: it
had carefully built a friendly "port isn't responding" HTML body — and returned
it with status **502**, so Cloudflare discarded body and all and substituted its
own interstitial.

**The tell:** our `x-kortix-proxy-hop` header was absent from what reached the
client. A response of yours that arrives without a header you always set was not
passed through — it was swapped. Check for one of your own headers before
believing the status you see came from your code.

**The error was semantic, not numeric.** "The dev server has not bound the port
yet" and "the box is waking" are the ordinary first seconds of a preview, not
gateway failures. A 5xx is an invitation every proxy in the chain accepts.

**Rules.**
1. For a top-level browser navigation, an expected/transient state answers **200
   with a page that explains itself and retries**. Reserve 5xx for genuine
   failure. Identity states (401/403/404) are safe — intermediaries pass those
   through, and a monitor should see them.
2. Keep the truth machine-readable: non-navigation requests keep the accurate
   status, and the state travels in a header (`x-kortix-preview-state`) set on
   the HTML too, so probes lose nothing.
3. Decide by `Sec-Fetch-Dest`, not by status — an app's own `fetch('/api')` must
   never receive HTML.

**Corollary paid for in the same session — a mock that weakens a production
constant asserts an unreachable branch.** A file-share test mocked
`PUBLIC_SHARE_BLOCKED_PORTS` as EMPTY. The real constant contains the
static-file port, so the shipped code refused the very case the test "proved"
worked. When mocking a module for its collaborators, carry its CONSTANTS
verbatim; a constant is the production behaviour, not a fixture.

*Incident:* no outage — dev only, reported by the product owner and fixed the
same session. Both the path proxy and the new origin were affected, so the 502
had been reachable long before preview origins existed.

## A comment saying "this was tried and reverted" is a decision record — read it before you overrule it

Found 2026-08-21. PR #6692 "the inbox owns the queue" made the prompt-queue
admission gate HOLD every queued prompt for as long as the session held turn
authority, instead of forwarding it into the running turn. It shipped to dev at
03:10 UTC and was reported broken by the product owner the same day: an agent
working 9m21s sat on two prompts queued 8 minutes earlier, delivering neither.

**The change was made to fix Remove.** Forwarding into a live turn made
`DELETE .../prompts/:id` answer 409 within ~1s of a send, because OpenCode
parents each STEP on the newest user message, so the running turn adopted the
prompt almost immediately. Holding did fix that — and removed the reason the
queue exists: what you type while the agent works being WITH the agent, picked
up the moment the turn ends.

**The codebase had already said so.** `inbox-admission.ts` carried, in its file
header, *"Holding was tried and reverted: the user wants what they typed to be
WITH the agent immediately"*, and the delivery test asserted the same. The PR
noted that line and overruled it, and described the cost as losing *batch
answering* rather than as losing the queue's whole point.

**Rules.**
1. A comment that records a REVERT is prior art with an owner and an outcome.
   Overruling it needs the same evidence the original decision had — ask the
   person, or reproduce the failure it describes. A one-line acknowledgement in
   a commit body is not that.
2. State the cost in the user's terms, not the implementation's. "A batch is no
   longer folded into one model step" and "the queue no longer sends between
   turns" are the same change; only the second one is reviewable.
3. When a fix for control (Remove) costs behaviour (delivery), fix the control
   on its own terms. Here that is `reachedPlacement` calling a prompt "answered"
   as soon as any step parents on it — `cancel-forwarded.ts` can already take an
   unread prompt back out of the runtime.

**Verification that settles it, on deployed dev:** post prompt A (long task),
wait for `GET .../turn` to report a non-empty `turns` array — that array IS
`sessionHoldsTurnAuthority`, the predicate the hold read — then post prompt B and
sample `GET .../prompts`. Held looks like `{state:'waiting',
reason:'turn_active'}` for the whole turn. Correct looks like `delivering` inside
2s and gone from the inbox while `turns` is still non-empty. Measured on
`acce6fbe22`: `delivering` at t+1.8s, gone at t+9.5s, turn still open.

*Incident:* dev only, ~14h from merge to revert. Reverted by PR #6699
(`acce6fbe22`), which restores the six queue files byte-for-byte to the
pre-#6692 tree and keeps only the two changes that touch no queue behaviour —
the non-transitive `compareMessagesForDisplay` fix, and the Remove toast reading
`error.status` instead of regexing `/409/` against `error.message` (that regex
could never match, so a 409 and a 404 rendered the same dead-end string, which is
why Remove looked like it simply never worked).

## A limit larger than the thing it protects is not a limit — and a rendered file is not a deploy

2026-08-21. The dev API was OOM-killed three times in eleven minutes (`exit 137`,
"OutOfMemoryError: container killed due to memory usage") during an image-heavy
agent session. Cloudflare answered the dead origin with its own page, so the
product showed **"Bad Gateway · Retrying in 53s"** and everyone — including me —
went looking for a code regression in the LLM gateway. There wasn't one.

**Diagnosis, in the order that worked.** `/v1/health` was failing 10–40% with
`server: cloudflare` and NO `x-kortix-*` or `x-amzn-*` header, so the response
never came from our code. That route runs no database query and no gateway
logic, which eliminated every application-level suspect at once. ECS then named
it outright: `exit 137`, three times.

**The metric that proved it was provisioning, not a regression.** Daily maximum
memory held a 65–70% band for ten consecutive days and broke it only that day
(85.5%) — while the AVERAGE stayed at ~37%, unchanged all month. *Peak without
drift is a few large allocations, never a leak and never load growth.* Learn to
read that pair; it is the whole diagnosis in two numbers.

**Three compounding causes, each its own rule.**

1. **A ceiling above the container is decoration.** `DEFAULT_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`
   was 1 GiB inside a 1024 MiB task and a 640 MiB self-host container — a single
   *permitted* request could exceed all the memory there was. A request-size cap
   is only meaningful as a FRACTION of process memory.

2. **Bounding one request is not bounding memory.** Per-request caps with
   unbounded concurrency still OOM; the crash just arrives later. Memory must be
   `O(concurrency)`, because concurrency is the only term a scaling policy
   controls. Shed with `503 + Retry-After` — a refusal costs one request, an OOM
   costs every request in flight plus the container. And a 503 is a pressure
   signal the autoscaler can SEE; an OOM looks like a task that stopped existing.

3. **Autoscaling on averages cannot see a single-task peak.** All three policies
   (average memory 70%, average CPU 60%, requests/target 600) sat idle through
   all three kills: the mean never moved, and requests peaked at 461 of 600.
   Alarm on `MemoryUtilization / Maximum`, never only `Average`.

**A rendered file is not a deploy.** A self-host `docker-compose.yml` is written
ONCE. `kortix self-host update` re-renders it, but the background
`kortix-updater` container only pulls images — so a box kept current by the
updater freezes its memory limits at the original render. Measured: a box
rendered while `llm-gateway` was a literal `512m` still had 512m months later,
straight through the update that raised the default to 2048m. **The fix shipped
and could not land.** `kortix-api` escaped only because it happened to be
`${KORTIX_API_MEMORY_LIMIT:-640m}` and could be moved from `.env`.

**The rule that follows: derive limits from reality, don't write them down.**
The process now reads its own cgroup limit at boot and takes a fraction. A stale
render becomes harmless, and more container memory becomes more throughput with
nothing to re-render.

**Corollary — parity is a safety property.** Dev ran `task_memory 1024` while
prod and staging ran `4096`, unchanged since at least Aug 15. Dev was the only
place this could surface first, and it surfaced in a founder's live session.

*Incident:* dev + one self-host box; no production impact (prod predated the
change). Fixed by #6705 (ceilings), #6708 (bounded memory + admission control),
#6712 (self-sizing). Verification that settles it: drive 60 concurrent 8 MiB
bodies at the REAL mounted routes and assert most are shed, every response is a
real status, no `unhandledRejection`/`uncaughtException`, and the process still
serves afterwards with the budget released.
