    # --env-file=scripts/test.env, NOT dotenvx: the unit suite is hermetic. It runs
    # off a committed plaintext file of fake values, so it behaves identically
    # on a laptop with no decryption key and on a CI runner that must never be
    # handed one. `--env-file` also stops bun auto-loading the encrypted .env,
    # which would otherwise inject `encrypted:…` ciphertext as var values.
    # Real credentials belong to `integration` and `live` above, which are not
    # part of this gate.

    # --isolate: bunfig.toml's `[test] isolation = true` documents the intent
    # (each test file gets a fresh global object, so mock.module() in one billing/
    # sandbox-proxy/etc. unit test can't leak into another's real, unmocked
    # module) but that config key isn't honored by this bun version's CLI —
    # the flag is required explicitly. Without it, cross-file mock.module()
    # collisions are order-dependent and can silently pass or fail depending
    # on which files happen to run adjacently.

    # but caused the archive contract to exceed its 15s timeout. Keep the safe
    # worker count bounded. The 15s default preserves explicit 15s test budgets
    # under load without increasing the duration of passing tests.
