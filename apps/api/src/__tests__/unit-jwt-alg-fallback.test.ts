/**
 * Regression cover for the 2026-08-21 prod near-miss.
 *
 * A project that has not been onboarded to Supabase signing keys publishes an
 * EMPTY JWKS, so `keyCache` stays empty and every token takes the `no-keys`
 * network fallback. The moment an asymmetric key is published — which happens
 * as soon as the legacy secret is imported, before anything is promoted — the
 * cache is no longer empty. Legacy HS256 tokens carry no `kid`, the key lookup
 * fell through to "first key in the cache", and the algorithm check then failed
 * as `unsupported-alg:HS256`, which the auth middleware treats as a definitive
 * rejection. Result: 401 on a perfectly valid session.

/**
 * These two assert only what holds in BOTH cache states, which is what makes
 * them safe in CI. With no Supabase reachable the JWKS cache is empty and the
 * verifier short-circuits at `no-keys`; with keys loaded a symmetric token now
 * stops at the algorithm check as `unsupported-alg`. Both are inconclusive, so
 * the routing decision is identical either way.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT asserted here: that a malformed token is a definitive
 * rejection. The verifier reaches the shape check only when keys are loaded, so
 * that outcome depends on whether Supabase happens to be up — it passed locally
 * and failed in CI. The semantics it was reaching for are pinned directly on
 * `isInconclusiveVerifyFailure` above, which needs no environment at all.
