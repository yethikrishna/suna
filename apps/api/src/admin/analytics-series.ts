/**
 * Pure aggregation helpers for the admin activity-analytics endpoints.
 *
 * Kept free of `db`, hono, and env so they are unit-testable in isolation
 * (`analytics-series.test.ts`). `analytics.ts` runs the SQL, then folds the
 * sparse grouped rows into a DENSE day series through these functions.
 *
 * Why dense matters: a `GROUP BY date_trunc('day', ...)` only emits days that
 * have rows. A chart fed that sparse list draws a straight line across a
 * zero-activity gap, which reads as "steady" when the truth is "nothing
 * happened". Every helper here emits one entry per calendar day in the window,
 * zero-filled.
 *
 * All dates are UTC. The API is read by operators in several timezones, so a
 * server-local day boundary would make the same query return different numbers
 * on different machines.
