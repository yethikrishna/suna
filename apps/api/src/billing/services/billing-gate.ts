  // cost at settle (recordGatewayUsage tops up the remainder or refunds the
  // unused portion) — see hooks.ts.
  //
  // Honest limitation: the hold amount is intentionally the existing (tiny,
  // 1-cent) admission floor, not a real estimate of the turn's eventual
  // cost — raising it would change product behavior for low-balance accounts
  // in a way out of scope here. That means the atomicity guarantee this
  // closes is "N concurrent requests can't all be admitted against a balance
  // that can't even cover N × 1 cent", not "an account can never end up
  // owing more than it had" — an expensive individual turn can still exceed
  // a thin balance before the top-up deduction at settle (that deduction
  // itself is still atomic and will never take the balance negative; the
  // residual exposure is Kortix failing to collect the marginal amount, not
  // an overdrawn account). See RELIABILITY-BACKLOG item 2 / PR description
