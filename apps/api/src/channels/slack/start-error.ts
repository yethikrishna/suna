/**
 * Honest, actionable copy for EVERY non-success outcome of starting a Slack
 * session — surfaced in-thread instead of a generic "try again" so a real
 * blocker tells the user exactly what to do. Every error shape the create path
 * (createProjectSession + the session lifecycle) can return is mapped here:
 * most-specific by `code`, then by HTTP status, then a safe generic fallback.
 *
 * The AGENT_NOT_DECLARED case is handled by its own inline-picker branch at the
 * call site (session.ts) — it needs interactive blocks, not a text line — so it
 * never reaches here.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-free (mirrors errors.ts) so it's unit-tested in isolation,
 * with no config/DB import to boot. Keep it exhaustive: an unmapped status must
 * still read sensibly and always leave the user a next step.
