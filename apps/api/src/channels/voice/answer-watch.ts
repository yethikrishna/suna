/**
 * Speaking a Kortix answer back into the call.
 *
 * The delivery half of Kortix→voice already works: `promptVoiceAgent` puts a
 * message on the call's LiveKit data channel and the worker turns it into
 * speech, no human utterance required. What was missing was anything to TRIGGER
 * it — so `ask_kortix` handed work to the session and the room waited forever.
 *
 * The obvious trigger would be the sandbox's own turn relay, but that relay is
 * gated on Slack env vars (`slackRelayContext` in
 * apps/kortix-sandbox-agent-server/src/main.ts — it returns null unless
 * SLACK_THREAD_TS/SLACK_CHANNEL_ID is set) and knows nothing about voice, so a
 * voice session's `step`/`answer`/`end` POSTs never leave the box. Fixing that
 * properly means changing the kortix-agent binary, which is BAKED INTO THE
 * SANDBOX IMAGE — a rebuild plus a rollout, and every sandbox that already
 * exists keeps the old binary regardless.
 *
 * So the API watches for the answer itself, over the same signed sandbox proxy
 * `opencode-mapping.ts` already uses to read a session's OpenCode state. That
 * works on sandboxes that exist TODAY and needs nothing rebuilt.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT on the request path: `askKortix` fires this and returns, so
 * the `ask_kortix` MCP tool still answers in milliseconds. Nothing here can
 * block a turn.
