/**
 * GET /v1/public/voice-join/:token — the anonymous resolve step behind every
 * `voice_spawn` join link.
 *
 * Genuinely public: no Authorization header, no session/PAT, no Supabase
 * cookie. The whole point of a voice join link is handing it to someone
 * outside the account (see apps/web/src/middleware.ts's PUBLIC_ROUTES entry
 * for `/voice`, which this route backs) — requiring login here would defeat
 * that. The token itself, not an authenticated identity, IS the access
 * control: 256 bits of `crypto.randomBytes` (join-links.ts's `mintJoinLink`),
 * unguessable, expiring, and revoked the moment its call ends.
 *
 * Deliberately mints a FRESH LiveKit access token on every resolve rather
 * than storing one: the join link can outlive a single page load (a refresh,
 * a dropped connection, a second device), and a short-lived join link handing
 * back a token whose own TTL is independent of it — see livekit.ts's
 * `mintAccessToken`'s DEFAULT_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS — means an open tab that sat
 * idle for a while still gets a token that works when it finally connects.

/**
 * GET /v1/public/voice-join/:token/transcript?cursor=N — the durable call
 * record for the ONE call this join link was minted for.
 *
 * Exists because LiveKit's client-side transcription is not the transcript.
 * It carries what the two voices said and nothing else, so the /voice page
 * used to show a call with holes in it: everything the Kortix agent sent into
 * the room (`send_prompt`, a finished turn's result, an error) and every MCP
 * tool call the voice made (`ask_kortix`, `run_command`) were missing —
 * they live in `kortix.voice_call_turns`, written server-side, and never
 * touch the browser's LiveKit stream at all. This is that record.
 *
 * AUTHORIZATION is the join link and only the join link — the same capability
 * the page already exchanged for its LiveKit token one route up, and the same
 * revocation (`endCall` → `revokeJoinLinksForCall` → 410). No Supabase
 * cookie, no PAT: whoever holds the link is in the call and can hear all of
 * this being said anyway.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a project- or session-scoped read. `resolveJoinLink`
 * returns the call id, and that call id is the ONLY thing that reaches
 * `readTurns` — the caller never names a call, a session or a project, so
 * there is no id for an anonymous caller to swap for someone else's. The
 * project id the link resolves to is not echoed back either; the page has no
 * use for it and it is not this visitor's to learn.
 *
 * Cursor-paged off the same monotonic `cursor` the Kortix agent's own
 * `read_transcript` uses, so a poll that finds nothing new returns an empty
 * list and the caller's own cursor back.
