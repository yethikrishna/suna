/**
 * `read_transcript` — the Kortix agent reading a live call, cheaply.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. The transcript was always cursor-paged, so the read
 * was already incremental — but only for an agent that threaded the returned
 * cursor back on every single call. An agent that forgot, or that simply began a
 * fresh turn without it, passed 0 and got the entire conversation again. On a
 * long call that is the same thousands of tokens re-read every turn for zero new
 * information, and it is the default failure because remembering a number across
 * turns is exactly the thing a model is worst at.
 *
 * So the position moves to the server. A bare `read_transcript {}` now means
 * "only what I have not been shown", the agent carries nothing, and the cheap
 * behaviour is the one you get by doing nothing. `kortix.voice_call_read_cursors`
 * holds it — one row per call, keyed by call id, which is also the session id.
 * See that migration for why it is its own table and not a column on
 * project_sessions.
 *
 * THE MODES, and why there are exactly four.
 *   unread (default)  what you have not seen. Advances your position.
 *   last              the newest N turns, ignoring your position. Re-orienting
 *                     mid-call ("what was just said?") without replaying an hour.
 *   full              the whole call, asked for explicitly. Advances.
 *   cursor            an explicit floor, for a caller doing its own bookkeeping.
 *                     Never advances, and `{"cursor":0}` still means the whole
 *                     call. The SEMANTICS are the pre-existing contract; the
 *                     wire shape is not, and saying "unchanged" here would be a
 *                     lie a future reader would act on. Two things did change,
 *                     for every mode alike: the turn shape lost its per-turn
 *                     `cursor` (see AgentTranscriptTurn), and the default page
 *                     is 100 rather than readTurns' 200 — a clip now reports
 *                     `truncated` so the caller pages on. Nothing in-repo read
 *                     this path (r7.ts and public-join-routes.ts call readTurns
 *                     directly with their own limits), so nothing broke.
 *
 * ADVANCING IS MUTATION, AND MUTATION CAN LOSE THINGS. If the position moves and
 * the agent's turn then dies before it does anything with what it read, those
 * turns are gone from `unread` forever. Three deliberate choices bound that:
 *
 *   1. The position advances ONLY to the highest cursor actually RETURNED, never
 *      to the head of the transcript. A page clipped by `limit` therefore leaves
 *      everything it did not hand over still unread. Nothing is ever marked read
 *      because it existed — only because it was delivered.
 *   2. Nothing is deleted, ever. `last` and `full` and an explicit `cursor` all
 *      still see every turn regardless of the position, so a turn that dies
 *      mid-read is recoverable in one call: `{"mode":"last","limit":20}`. That
 *      is the documented recovery, and it is why `last` exists at all rather
 *      than being a nicety.
 *   3. `peek: true` reads unread WITHOUT advancing, for a caller that wants to
 *      look before it commits.
 *
 * We do NOT ack-on-next-read or keep a two-phase delivered/confirmed pointer:
 * the agent has no ack to give, so a second pointer would only move the same
 * loss one turn later while doubling the state anyone has to reason about. A
 * duplicated read costs tokens; the recovery costs one call. Losing the turns
 * outright is the only unacceptable outcome, and (2) rules it out.
 *
 * WHY THE ACTION IS STILL `risk: 'read'`. It mutates, but only the caller's own
 * read position — bookkeeping about the reader, not about the call. Nothing
 * about the room, the conversation or the transcript changes; no other reader
 * observes it (the call page polls with its own explicit cursor and never
 * touches this row); and it is recoverable by (2). Grading it `write` would put
 * the agent's cheapest and most-encouraged action — read at the top of every
 * turn — behind approval in stricter policy modes, which would cost far more
 * than the honesty is worth. The honest escape hatch is `peek`.
