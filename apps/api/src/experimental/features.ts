/**
 * Unified experimental-feature registry.
 *
 * We ship fast and we ship a lot. Some surfaces are real and usable but still
 * moving — they may change shape or break between versions. Rather than block
 * them behind a release or scatter one-off env flags, we expose them as
 * EXPERIMENTAL features that a project can opt into. This lets us soft-release:
 * push versions, dogfood, and let users try them per project — without treating
 * them as committed "prod" surface.
 *
 * Each feature has two gates:
 *   • available  — does the PLATFORM support it at all (operator env)? When a
 *                  feature is unavailable, the per-project toggle is hidden and
 *                  the surface stays dark no matter what a project has chosen.
 *   • enabled    — the EFFECTIVE per-project state: the project's explicit
 *                  choice (projects.metadata.experimental[key]) over the
 *                  operator default. `enabled` always implies `available`.
 *
 * Per-project state is DB-only (projects.metadata) — never in kortix.yaml. To
 * add a feature: append an entry below and gate its surface on
 * `resolveExperimentalFeature(metadata, key)`. The UI renders straight from
 * {@link buildExperimentalCatalog}, so a new entry lights up everywhere.

/**
 * The registry. Order here is the order shown in Customize → Settings →

 *
 * agent_tunnel → connector: connected machines flow through the Executor as a
 * regular `computer` connector (one connector fronts all the account's machines;
 * `connectors`/`discover`/`describe`/`call`, one audit + policy path). That
 * connector is NO LONGER gated by this flag — it auto-materializes whenever the
 * account has a connected machine, exactly like the Slack channel connector
 * (see executor/computer-materialize.ts). This flag now only gates the dedicated
 * tunnel surface (Customize → Computers, the device-auth / permissions UI).
 * See docs/specs/computer-connector.md.
