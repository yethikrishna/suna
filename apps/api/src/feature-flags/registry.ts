/**
 * Unified feature-flag registry.
 *
 * We ship fast and we ship a lot. Any surface — experimental, beta, or fully
 * stable — can ship dark behind a per-project flag and be turned on from
 * Settings → Feature flags. "Experimental" is a stability badge on a flag,
 * not the system's name.
 *
 * Each flag has two gates:
 *   • available  — does the PLATFORM support it at all (operator env)? When a
 *                  flag is unavailable, the per-project toggle is hidden and
 *                  the surface stays dark no matter what a project has chosen.
 *   • enabled    — the EFFECTIVE per-project state: the project's explicit
 *                  choice (projects.metadata.experimental[key]) over the
 *                  operator default. `enabled` always implies `available`.
 *
 * Per-project state is DB-only (projects.metadata) — never in kortix.yaml.
 * The `experimental` metadata key is a stable storage detail; do not rename it.
 *
 * To add a flag, the key goes in SIX places. Typecheck forces only one of them
 * (the SDK union), so do not rely on a clean build:
 *
 *   1. `FeatureFlagMapSchema` — packages/api-contract/src/index.ts
 *   2. TWO sites in packages/api-contract/src/__tests__/schemas.test.ts: a
 *      project fixture, and a hand-written copy of the key list
 *   3. The `FeatureFlagKey` union AND the `FEATURE_FLAG_KEYS` array —
 *      packages/sdk/.../projects-client/projects.ts. Only the union is
 *      typechecked; a missing array entry compiles fine.
 *   4. Another hand-written copy in that package's projects.test.ts
 *   5. An entry below, DECLARING its enforcement mode
 *   6. One `useFeatureFlag` call + one map entry in
 *      apps/web/src/lib/use-project-feature-flags.ts (and move the trailing
 *      `isLoading:` to the newly-last hook)
 *
 * Then gate its routes with `requireFeatureFlag` (enforcement: 'routes'), or
 * its runtime behavior on `resolveFeatureFlag` (enforcement: 'behavioral').
 *
 * FOUR separate tests guard those six sites, each in its own package, so each
 * one fails only when that package's suite runs — they surface one CI round at
 * a time. `unit-feature-flag-drift.test.ts` compares contract <-> SDK <->
 * registry and catches 1/3/5 only. List every holder before you start:
 *
 *   rg -l "meta_agent" --glob '!node_modules' . | xargs rg -l "review_center"
 *
 * The UI renders straight from {@link buildFeatureFlagCatalog}, so a new entry
 * lights up in Settings automatically. `unit-feature-flags.test.ts` pins the
 * catalog to the contract key list and requires every entry to declare its
 * enforcement.

/**
 * How the flag is actually enforced server-side. This is a declaration the
 * tests read — it makes "the switch does nothing on the server" an explicit,
 * reviewed decision instead of silent drift.
 *
 *  • 'routes'     — HTTP surface rejects with 403 `feature_disabled` when off
 *                   (via `requireFeatureFlag`).
 *  • 'behavioral' — no dedicated routes; the flag changes what the platform
 *                   does (connector materialization, env injection, agent
 *                   list). Off ⇒ the behavior does not occur.
 *  • 'ui-only'    — the server deliberately does NOT enforce; the flag only
 *                   hides client surface. Requires `enforcementNote` naming
 *                   the decision. Use sparingly.
