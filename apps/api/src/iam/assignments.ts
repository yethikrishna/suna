/**
 * The ONE write path for authorization.
 *
 * Today there are 129 production write sites across 5 stores, each with its own
 * shape, its own (or no) authorization check, its own (or no) cache bust and its
 * own (or no) audit event — SCIM's 20 sites run under a bearer token with no
 * `assertAuthorized` anywhere, and `syncSsoMembership` mutates membership from
 * inside the auth middleware on every SAML request. Every one of them becomes a
 * call to `assignRole` / `revokeAssignment`.
 *
 * Each call: authorizes the WRITER, enforces the last-owner and delegability
 * ceilings, writes exactly ONE row, busts the caches that row invalidates, and
 * emits exactly ONE audit event.
 *
 * SCIM and SSO JIT keep bypassing user-authz by design — an IdP is not a user —
 * but they pass `source: 'scim' | 'sso'` and a system actor, so they no longer
 * bypass the store, the cache contract, or the audit trail.
