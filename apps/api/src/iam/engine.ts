// IAM engine — public type surface only.
//
// The V1 policy-based engine implementation (authorize, listAccessibleResources,
// policyMatchesTarget, checkConditions, actionPassesBoundary, system-role
// permission cache) lived in this file until PR5d, when V2 became the only
// authorization path. The file is kept as a type-only module so that
// downstream importers keep working without churn. As of the canonical-RBAC
// refactor NOTHING in the production graph imports this: it survives only to
// type `./engine-v2`, which in turn survives only to feed the verdict-parity
// harness during the dual-read window (spec §5). Both go with the cutover PR.
//
// AccessibleResources is the wider V1 union (it had an additional
// 'all_except' variant) collapsed to what V2 actually returns.
