/**
 * API/control-plane managed model overlay used by runtime routing and catalog
 * responses. CLOUD-ONLY: empty whenever KORTIX_MANAGED_PROVIDER_ENABLED is off
 * (the self-host default) — a self-host operator brings their own LLM keys and
 * must never see or route to Kortix's shared upstream credentials.
 * This is the single choke point: every consumer (the served model catalog,
 * the picker, and request-time routing) reads through here or getRuntimeManagedModel()
 * below, so gating it here alone keeps the managed lineup off everywhere.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — what the "managed provider" IS and IS NOT (a recurring
 * misconception): KORTIX_MANAGED_PROVIDER_ENABLED is a CLOUD-ONLY CONVENIENCE
 * so cloud users can spend their KORTIX CREDITS for a zero-config experience —
 * it routes to Kortix's own shared upstream credentials, billed as credits.
 * It is not the mechanism by which Bedrock or OpenRouter is available.
 * Bedrock is a standalone provider that a project uses by connecting
 * its OWN credentials (BYOK). To give a self-host Bedrock you connect Bedrock
 * as a standalone BYOK provider (project secret AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK →
 * resolveCatalogUpstream('amazon-bedrock') builds a kind:'bedrock' descriptor
 * via the normal BYOK path); you do NOT turn this flag on. This managed overlay
 * stays purely the cloud credits convenience.
