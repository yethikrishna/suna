/**
 * What a customer is told when their plan has no managed inference.
 *
 * Both the free tier and every v3 credit plan (Starter / Team / Scale) block
 * managed models, but for opposite reasons, and one message cannot serve both.
 * "Upgrade your plan" is true for free and plainly false for a Starter
 * subscriber — they are paying; managed models are simply not bundled, and the
 * remedy is a provider key, not a bigger plan.
 *
 * Getting this wrong sends a paying customer to the pricing page to buy
 * something they already have.
