/**
 * Response compression for the API.
 *
 * ─── Why (measured, 2026-08-26) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The API shipped every response as raw bytes: a request carrying
 * `accept-encoding: gzip` got back exactly as many bytes as one carrying none.
 * These payloads are JSON and compress extremely well —
 *
 *   GET /v1/projects/:id/sessions   98 466 B ->  6 296 B   (15.6×, 60 sessions)
 *   GET /v1/p/<ext>/8000/agent     139 KB    ->  ~8.6 KB   (16.1×, WS-V)
 *
 * — and the browser fetches the inventory several times per session open.
 * Transfer, not database work, is what the client waits on there: the same list
 * costs ~7 ms of server time and ~100 KB on the wire.
 *
 * ─── Why this is NOT the usual "compress if content-length > N" ─────────────
 * Under Bun, `Response.headers.get('content-length')` is `null` inside
 * middleware even for a fixed string body — Bun computes the length when it
 * serializes, after every middleware has run. A length-gated implementation
 * therefore compresses nothing at all, silently. (Verified in situ: the session
 * list reached this middleware with `content-length: null` and a 98 KB body.)
 *
 * So the size test is done by PEEKING the body instead, and the peek is capped
 * at `COMPRESSION_MIN_BYTES`:
 *
 *   - The body ends inside the first kilobyte -> it is small. Emit the bytes we
 *     already hold, uncompressed, WITH an accurate `content-length`. Nothing was
 *     buffered beyond 1 KB and nothing was compressed that was not worth it.
 *   - The body is still going after a kilobyte -> it is worth compressing. Emit
 *     the peeked prefix followed by the rest of the original stream, the whole
 *     thing piped through `CompressionStream`.
 *
 * Memory is bounded at one kilobyte per in-flight response either way. A large
 * body is never accumulated — that would re-create the gateway OOM shape, where
 * multi-megabyte transcript bodies were held whole in memory.
 *
 * ─── The safety rule: only a content type we NAME gets compressed ───────────
 * Compressing a live stream breaks it: `CompressionStream` emits nothing until
 * a deflate block fills, so events stop arriving on time and a "live" surface
 * silently dies. The type allowlist below is what keeps this middleware away
 * from every streaming surface — `text/event-stream` (the turn stream, the
 * sandbox `/event` SSE), `application/x-ndjson`, the git pack types, the LLM
 * gateway's completions — and away from bytes that are already compressed
 * (images, tarballs, snapshots), where a second pass costs CPU and adds size.
 *
 * It is an allowlist, not a denylist, deliberately: an unknown type is far more
 * likely to be one of those than a text format we forgot. A new streaming route
 * is therefore excluded by default rather than by remembering to exclude it.
 *
 * Plus the ordinary HTTP guards: a client that did not ask for an encoding, a
 * body that is already encoded, a bodiless status (204/304), a 101 upgrade, and
 * a partial 206 all pass through untouched.
 */

/**
 * The smallest body worth compressing, and the exact number of bytes this
 * middleware will ever hold for one response.
 *
 * Below roughly this size the gzip header and trailer, and the switch from a
 * declared length to chunked transfer, are a bigger deal than the saving — and
 * most API responses (`{"ok":true}`, a status poll, a 402) are far below it.
