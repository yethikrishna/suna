 * The connector PAT injected into every sandbox carries the LAUNCHING USER's id —
 * in Kortix-as-a-Backend that is the wrapper's own credential owner, who is a
 * project manager. The connection list's former manager rule
 * handed a prompt-injected agent in end-user A's sandbox the connection_id, owner_id
 * and label of every OTHER end-user's `external` connection. From there a single
 * session create with `connector_bindings` runs as B's Gmail.
 *
 * Nothing in the session-isolation work touches this, because the escalation
 * never reads a session row — it reads the connector surface directly.
 *
 * `GET /projects/:id/secrets` already solved the same shape: a session-bound
 * token must not ENUMERATE what its session cannot use, or the narrowing that
 * scrubs values from the env still leaks their identity. This is that rule for
 * connectors.
