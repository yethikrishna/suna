// Server-side manifest-version verdict for GET /projects/:id/detail.
//
// The manifest declares its own schema version: `kortix_version` is REQUIRED by
// every published schema (`kortix.v1.schema.json` and
// `kortix.v2.schema.json` each pin it to a
// `const`). So the version is read, never inferred — there is no sniffing of
// which keys happen to be present.
//
// The rule this module exists to enforce: an unknown version is NEVER reported
// as v1. A manifest that is absent, unparseable, version-less, or hidden by IAM
// is `version: null` with an `unknown_reason`, and offers no migration. The old
// client-side detector defaulted all four of those cases to v1, so every
// project whose manifest could not be read was told to "upgrade".
//
// `migration_offered` is deliberately NOT `version < latest_version`. It is true
// only when MIGRATIONS below has an implemented, agent-runnable upgrade for that
// version, and `target_version` is the version that migration actually produces.
// Advertising a jump the product cannot perform is the same class of bug as
// advertising one that is not needed.
