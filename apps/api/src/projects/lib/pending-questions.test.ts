/**
 * Park-and-restore: the box may die on time, the question may not.
 *
 * A turn waiting on a human makes no gateway LLM calls, so it earns no deadline
 * extension and its box is parked on schedule. That is correct and must stay
 * correct — the bounded-lifetime design rests on "only a control-plane-OBSERVED
 * event may extend a box", and a box that could keep itself alive by reporting
 * "still waiting" is the self-renewal that once left 187 boxes running, the
 * oldest for 264 hours.
 *
 * The bug was that parking DESTROYED the question: opencode restarts cold, so
 * the user returned to a session that had forgotten what it asked.
 *
 * The two properties worth pinning are therefore:
 *   1. recording a question does NOT extend anything, and
 *   2. a replayed relay does not become two prompts.
