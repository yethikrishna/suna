/**
 * Park-and-restore for a blocked turn.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. When the agent calls the `question` tool it stops and waits for
 * a human. A waiting turn makes no gateway LLM calls, so it earns no deadline
 * extension, so its box is parked on schedule. That part is correct and must
 * stay correct: the whole bounded-lifetime design rests on "only a
 * control-plane-OBSERVED event may extend a box", and a box that could keep
 * itself alive by saying "I'm still waiting" is exactly the self-renewal that
 * once left 187 boxes running, the oldest for 264 hours.
 *
 * What was wrong is what parking DESTROYED. opencode restarts cold, so its
 * in-memory pending question died with the box and the user came back to a
 * session that had silently forgotten what it asked. The turn was lost, not
 * paused.
 *
 * THE FIX is to separate the two. Let the box die on time; keep the question
 * out here, where it survives. Recording a question therefore does NOT touch
 * the deadline — deliberately, and the tests assert it.
 *
 * The relay is best-effort and retries, so recording is an upsert keyed on
 * (session_id, request_id): the same question arriving twice must not become
 * two prompts in the UI.
