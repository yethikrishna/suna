/**
 * Request-level dedupe for POST /v1/projects/provision.
 *
 * THE DEFECT. That route mints a brand-new managed repo on every call, and its
 * only guard was `enforceProjectQuota` — a straight count. On any account whose
 * quota permits two or more projects, a retry after a lost response (a reload,
 * a second onboarding tab, an aborted request, a client-side retry) created a
 * real duplicate project WITH ITS OWN upstream GitHub repo. That is how users
 * ended up with several "My First Project" rows.
 *
 * THE FIX. The caller sends the same `idempotency_key` for every attempt at one
 * logical create. The route looks it up BEFORE `backend.createRepo` and returns
 * the project the first attempt made. Two properties matter and neither is
 * optional:
 *
 *   1. The check runs before anything exists upstream. After `createRepo` a
 *      GitHub repo is already there, and deduping later leaves it orphaned.
 *   2. The key lives on the project row, not in this process. The API runs
 *      several replicas; an in-memory map deduplicates neither a restart nor a
 *      retry that lands on another instance.
 *
 * The pre-check is a read, so two simultaneous calls can both miss it. The
 * partial unique index `idx_projects_account_idempotency_key` is what actually
 * makes "exactly one" true; `isProvisionIdempotencyConflict` lets the route
 * recognise the loser of that race, drop the repo it just minted, and return
 * the winner's project.

/**
 * How long after a project row appears its provision is still assumed to be
 * RUNNING, and therefore still able to roll itself back.
 *
 * WHY A WINDOW EXISTS AT ALL. The create path inserts the row with
 * `metadata.git.seed = {expected:true, seeded:false}` and only THEN pushes the
 * scaffold. If that push fails it deletes the upstream repo AND
 * `db.delete(projects)` the row it just inserted (`../provision-core.ts`, the
 * seed rollback inside `runProvision`). A replay served during that gap hands
 * the caller a `project_id` that is about to stop existing — and its next
 * retry, finding nothing, creates a second project. That is the exact
 * double-submit case the key exists for, so a fresh pending row must be a
 * retryable `409`, never a confident `201`.
 *
 * WHY IT MUST EXPIRE. A pod killed mid-seed leaves `{expected:true,
 * seeded:false}` on the row permanently. `shouldSelfHealManagedRepoSeed`
 * (`../managed-repo-seed.ts`) is what repairs that on next access, so an
 * unbounded in-flight check would make such a project un-replayable forever —
 * trading a rare wrong `201` for a guaranteed permanent `409`.
 *
 * WHY 120s. It is the longest window any first-party client waits on this exact
 * route: `@kortix/sdk`'s `provisionProject` sends `timeout: 120_000`
 * (`provisionProjectWithToken` uses 90s, and Bun's `idleTimeout: 45` closes the
 * socket even earlier — `/provision` is exempt from the 25s request deadline
 * but not from that). Past 120s no caller is still attached to the original
 * request, so a row still pending is far more likely a dead provision than live
 * work, and the self-heal path is the right owner. Residual, stated plainly: a
 * provision whose seed is still running at 121s and fails at 122s can still
 * strand one replayed id. Narrowing that further would cost recovery time on
 * the far more common crashed-seed case.
 *
 * THE WINDOW IS APPROXIMATE, BY TWO CLOCKS. `createdAt` is written by the
 * DATABASE (`defaultNow()`); `now` is the API pod's `Date.now()`. Clock skew
 * between them shifts the effective window by the skew, in either direction. It
 * is bounded by the skew, self-correcting on the caller's next retry, and not
 * worth a redesign — but do not read this bound as exact.
