/**
 * The control channel's PRODUCER.
 *
 * ─── WHY A RECONCILER AND NOT PUBLISH CALLS SCATTERED THROUGH THE WRITERS ──
 * The obvious design is to call `publishControlEvent` from every place that
 * changes a queue row, stamps a turn, or advances a wake. It is also the wrong
 * one here, for one reason that no amount of care at the call sites fixes:
 * **the API runs many instances.** A publish reaches only the streams served by
 * the same process, so a client attached to instance B would silently never
 * learn about a queue row admitted on instance A — and "silently never" is
 * strictly worse than the polling it replaces.
 *
 * So the contract is convergence, not notification. One reconciler per session
 * per instance re-reads the control plane on a cadence and emits a frame ONLY
 * when the answer changed. Correctness never depends on a writer remembering to
 * announce itself, and it never depends on which instance served the write.
 * `publishControlEvent` stays available as a same-instance latency
 * optimisation, and nothing is built on top of it.
 *
 * ─── THE COST, STATED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Four subsystem reads per {@link CONTROL_RECONCILE_MS} per session that has at
 * least one stream open — and ZERO for a session nobody is watching. It
 * replaces the per-tab `GET .../prompts` timer. The client keeps one owner
 * polling `GET .../turn` as a recovery path because transport presence does
 * not prove that control frames are arriving.
 *
 * ─── EVERY EMISSION IS A FULL SNAPSHOT ─────────────────────────────────────
 * See `session-control-events.ts`. A frame carries its subsystem's whole state,
 * so a client that missed one is corrected by the next rather than corrupted by
 * it, and a reconnect needs no replay to be correct.
