/**
 * A SOURCE-LEVEL guard on the one property of the provision dedupe that no
 * unit test of `../lib/provision-idempotency.ts` can express: WHERE the check
 * sits in `runProvision` (`../provision-core.ts`).
 *
 * `backend.createRepo` creates a real repository on the managed git host. A
 * dedupe that runs after it still returns the right project — and still leaves
 * an orphaned upstream repo behind on every retry, which is most of the defect
 * the key exists to fix. The lookup is only worth anything above that call.
 *
 * Reads the file as text. No database, no GitHub, no `mock.module` (which is
 * process-wide in this app and leaks into sibling suites) — same shape as
 * `../sandbox-deadline-call-sites.test.ts`.
 *
 * REPOINTED by Task 16 (workspace-switcher, 2026-08-06): this guard used to
 * read `r1.ts`'s POST /provision handler directly. That handler's body now
 * lives in `runProvision` (`../provision-core.ts`), extracted so a streaming
 * variant of the route can share it instead of forking a second copy of the
 * create logic. Every assertion below is UNCHANGED IN SUBSTANCE — only the
 * file it reads, and the markers used to slice out the handler body, moved
 * with the code. `r1.ts`'s own POST /provision handler is now a thin wrapper
 * (`buildProvisionContext` + `runProvision` + `c.json(result.body, ...)`)
 * with nothing left in it for a source guard to check.
