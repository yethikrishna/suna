/**
 * Authorization on the two park-and-restore question routes.
 *
 * Both gates were missing when the routes first landed, and both are the kind
 * that no functional test notices: the happy path — an owner reading and
 * answering their own question — passes identically with and without them.
 *
 *   GET  must require `project.session.read`. The question text is session
 *        CONTENT. `loadProjectForUser(…, 'read')` is only the coarse project
 *        floor, so a caller whose custom role or scoped token has the leaf
 *        revoked still clears it and reads the text.
 *
 *   POST must refuse agent-session tokens. The `question` tool exists so the
 *        agent yields to a human. An agent token is scoped to its own session —
 *        exactly the session holding the question it just asked — so if it
 *        could POST here it would answer itself and resume.
 *
 * These assert on the SOURCE of the two handlers rather than by driving the
 * route: r4.ts is a single 3k-line OpenAPI registration file with no per-route
 * export to import, and standing up the app pulls in the whole API. The
 * assertions are therefore scoped to each handler's own body and check
 * ORDERING — a gate that runs after the thing it protects is not a gate.
