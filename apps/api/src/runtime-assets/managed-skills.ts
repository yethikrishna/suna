/**
 * The managed `kortix-*` skill overlay, as data.
 *
 * ONE definition of "which files the overlay is made of", used by both places
 * that ship it:
 *
 *   • build time — `stageManagedSkills` (snapshots/build-context.ts) writes this
 *     exact set into the META image's `/opt/kortix/managed-skills`,
 *   • run time  — `GET /v1/runtime-assets/managed-skills` serves it to a live
 *     sandbox, which writes it to the same path and re-runs the daemon's
 *     `ensureInjectedManagedSkills` overlay.
 *
 * That second path is what closes the per-project gap: only the meta image ever
 * baked `/opt/kortix/managed-skills`, so an ordinary project sandbox had nothing
 * to overlay and its skills were whatever its repo happened to carry.
 *
 * The extraction deliberately matches the build-time one exactly — same
 * `getManagedSkillFiles()` + `getStarterFiles({ template:
 * 'general-knowledge-worker' })` sources, same `isKortixManagedSkillName` filter
 * — so a sandbox converges on the SAME bytes the image would have baked, not a
 * superset. `getMarketplaceFiles()` is intentionally absent (see
 * skills/catalog.ts, which does include it: that surface answers "read any
 * managed skill", this one answers "what does the overlay contain").
