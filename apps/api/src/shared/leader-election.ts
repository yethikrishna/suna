/**
 * Background-worker leader election (lease-table based).
 *
 * The API runs as N replicas on ECS Fargate (prod: min 2, up to 10). Request-
 * path code is stateless and safe on every replica, but the SINGLETON background
 * loops (cron trigger scheduler, project maintenance, legacy-migration worker,
 * snapshot pre-build, grant-expiry sweep) must run on
 * exactly ONE replica — otherwise every cron trigger fires N times (N duplicate
 * paid agent sessions + duplicate external side effects), etc.
 *
 * We elect a single leader with a TTL lease row in `kortix.worker_leader_lease`.
 * One atomic UPSERT both acquires (when the row is absent or its lease expired)
 * and renews (when we already own it); a non-owning live lease yields no row, so
 * the caller knows it lost. The leader renews well within the TTL; if it dies or
 * partitions, the lease expires and another replica takes over within ~TTL.
 *
 * Why a lease table and NOT pg_advisory_lock: prod connects through the Supabase
 * pooler (`prepare: false`), which in transaction mode does not pin a backend
 * across statements — so SESSION-level advisory locks are unreliable there. A
 * lease row is just a normal upsert and works identically through any pooler,
 * with 1 replica or many. With no DATABASE_URL (self-host single node) we skip
 * coordination entirely and run as the sole leader.
