// account request. When the account has canonical billing state it early-exits
// on one DB read, but for accounts with a Stripe customer mapping and no
// active paid subscription it used to re-run the FULL Stripe dance every
// request (customers.search by email + retrieve + subscriptions.list per
// candidate — observed 8-12s) because a no-find persists nothing. The memo
// caches the attempt itself so at most one request per hour pays it, and the
// timeout caps what that one request pays — the sync keeps running in the

// recovery side effect (its result is never read here), so skipping the wait

 * membership, which makes /accounts/<other>?tab=billing nonsensical.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. `?account_id=` (query) or `body.account_id` if provided → verify the
 *      caller is a member of that account, then return it. 403 on miss.
 *   2. Fall back to `resolveAccountId(userId)` — the user's primary
 *      membership. Preserves legacy behaviour for surfaces that haven't
 *      been migrated to send `account_id` yet.
 *
 * Pass `source: 'body'` for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE routes (we read the JSON
 * body once and look for `account_id`). Pass `source: 'query'` for GETs.
