/**
 * The kortix-managed system skills, as data.
 *
 * These are the `kortix-*` markdown skills that tell an agent how Kortix itself
 * works (sessions, sandboxes, the executor/approval loop, memory, channels, the
 * CLI). Until now they were only reachable two ways: scaffolded into a project's
 * git tree by `kortix init`, or baked into the sandbox image at
 * `/opt/kortix/managed-skills` and overlaid per session. Both require being
 * *inside* Kortix. An OpenCode agent holding only the `kortix` binary and a
 * token had no way to read them.
 *
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH: `@kortix/starter`. This module runs the exact same extraction
 * as `packages/starter/scripts/write-managed-skills.ts` (the script that bakes the
 * sandbox image) — same `getStarterFiles()` call, same `projectName: 'Kortix'`
 * interpolation, same `isKortixManagedSkillName()` filter — so what the API serves
 * is byte-identical to what a session gets overlaid. `@kortix/starter` is already
 * an apps/api dependency and its `templates/` tree is COPYed into the API image
 * (see apps/api/Dockerfile), so the served text ships with the deploy and cannot
 * drift from the running version. No git clone, no network fetch, no cache to
 * invalidate.
 *
 * `getMarketplaceFiles()` is included alongside the starter walk because one
 * managed name — `kortix-computer` — lives in the `marketplace` template layer
 * rather than the base/general-knowledge-worker layers. Without it that skill
 * would be listed in `KORTIX_MANAGED_SKILL_NAMES` but unresolvable here.
