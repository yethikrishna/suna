/**
 * Snapshot build error classification.
 *
 * A failed snapshot build is the single most product-breaking failure in the
 * platform: no ready image means new sessions can't boot. To recover well we
 * need to know *why* a build failed so the UI can route it correctly — a
 * Dockerfile bug is fixable by an agent (edit the repo, open a CR), while a
 * dead dev tunnel or a Daytona gateway blip is infrastructure the user just
 * retries.
 *
 * The classifier is intentionally heuristic (regex over the error string) —
 * Daytona/Docker don't give us structured error codes. Order matters: the
 * most specific buckets are checked first.
