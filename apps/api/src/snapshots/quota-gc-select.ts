/**
 * Pure selection logic for the snapshot quota GC.
 *
 * Split out from quota-gc.ts (which owns the DB + provider IO) so the rules that
 * decide what gets DELETED are unit-testable without a database, a Daytona org, or
 * a clock. Nothing here imports config, db, or a provider.
 *
 * ── Why the old pressure gate could never fire ──────────────────────────────
 * The Daytona quota (100) counts EVERY snapshot in the org: our templates, our
 * per-project warm images, and Daytona's own stock/bench images. The old gate
 * counted only `kortix-default-` / `kortix-tpl-` / `kortix-wproj-`. Measured live
 * (2026-07-08): 120 snapshots tripped the cap while that namespace held 98 — and
 * after a manual reclaim, 68 total against a GC-visible 15. With ~46 ppwarm + 22
 * stock images uncounted, the namespace would have to reach 60 before GC woke up,
 * i.e. an org total of ~128 — nearly 30 snapshots past the ceiling it defends.
 * The gate is therefore on the ORG TOTAL, which is what the quota actually meters.
 *
 * ── Why defaults can't use an idle gate ─────────────────────────────────────
 * The platform default is resolved dynamically from the runtime fingerprint; it is
 * NOT stored in `sandbox_templates.provider_snapshot_name` (only custom `kortix-tpl-`
 * rows and dev's default are). So "referenced" never protects it, and a *superseded*
 * default keeps a fresh `lastUsedAt` — it was the live default until minutes ago.
 * A 7-day idle rule makes zero defaults eligible while ~4.5/day accrue. Freshness
 * rank, not idle time, is the only signal that separates live from superseded:
 * every live environment boots its default constantly, so the live ones are always
 * in the freshest few. Reaping a still-live default is self-healing — the next boot
 * hits the snapshot-missing auto-heal and rebuilds (one slow boot, no data loss).
 *
 * ── Cross-environment safety ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * dev / staging / prod / laptops share ONE Daytona org but have SEPARATE databases.
 * This process can only see its own DB. So "no project row for this proj8" does NOT
 * mean the project is gone — it may be another environment's. `lastUsedAt` is the
 * only cross-env liveness signal we have, and it is the sole basis on which a
 * ppwarm tip belonging to nobody-we-know is reclaimed.
 *
 * ── Why ppwarm needs an LRU budget, not just a liveness rule ────────────────
 * `kortix-ppwarm-<proj8>-<hash>` is minted unconditionally on session-start of the
 * shared default (builder.ts), one live tip per project. So the cache's floor is the
 * number of projects that have ever started a session. Measured 2026-07-08: 69 tips
 * for 69 distinct, non-archived projects — 69 of the org's 100 slots, before a single
 * default or user template. Liveness rules reclaim NOTHING there (every tip is a live
 * project's only tip), so a purely liveness-based GC sits at 100% pressure doing
 * nothing, which is exactly the outage we hit.
 *
 * ppwarm is a pure CACHE — evicting a tip costs one cold boot plus a re-bake, never
 * data — so it is the namespace that absorbs budget pressure. Evict LRU until the org
 * is back at target, skipping recently-used tips (they'd re-bake at once: churn, not
 * reclamation). When even that can't reach target, `budgetUnresolved` is set so the
 * caller can alarm — a GC that silently can't keep up is how this failed the first
 * time. The real remedy at that point is capacity (raise the org snapshot quota) or
 * gating the warm bake; GC can only buy time.
