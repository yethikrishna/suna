/**
 * Snapshot quota GC — reclaim superseded snapshots before the org-wide cap bites.
 *
 * Template snapshots are content-addressed (`kortix-default-<hash>` /
 * `kortix-tpl-<hash>`), so every identity drift (each release bumps the runtime
 * fingerprint; every Dockerfile/spec edit) mints a NEW name and silently
 * orphans the old one. Nothing else deletes them: the only same-name deletes
 * run while that exact identity is being rebuilt. Measured live (2026-06-12):
 * ~4.5 new snapshots/day against the 100/org Daytona quota — exhaustion in days,
 * at which point every build org-wide starts failing.
 *
 * This file owns the IO (DB reads, provider deletes). The RULES live in
 * quota-gc-select.ts as a pure function — including the two hard-won invariants:
 * the pressure gate must measure the ORG TOTAL (not just our namespace), and
 * platform defaults must be ranked by freshness (not idle time). See that file's
 * header for why each of those was wrong before, and for the cross-environment
 * safety argument (one Daytona org, many databases).
 *
 * Never acts on a partial view: if the org listing fails, the pass does nothing.
