# Kortix self-host auto-updater. Runs inside the `kortix-updater` Compose
# service (image: docker:cli, docker socket mounted). Once a day, at a fixed
# local clock time, it pulls this stack's published image tags and, if
# anything actually changed, rolls the stack forward with ZERO downtime: a
# start-first swap per stateless service (new replicas healthy before old
# ones stop). Single-flight via flock so an overlapping run never races.
#
# Resilience invariants this script enforces (see the production-readiness
# audit this file was hardened against — every point below is a fix for a
# confirmed finding, not speculative):
#   1. A failed per-service swap never aborts the rest of the rollout — every
#      changed service is attempted, so the fleet never gets stuck mid-
#      sequence on a MIX of app-tier versions against an already-migrated DB
#      (see the update routine below). A degraded outcome self-heals on the next run
#      because service_up_to_date() always re-detects the stale service.
#   2. A failed run NEVER crashes this standing container — the scheduler
#      loop only ever calls run_locked() through `||`, which neutralizes
#      `set -e` for that call (see the main loop at the bottom). No future
#      nightly is ever silently skipped because today's run errored.
#   3. Every run's outcome (ok/degraded/failed/skipped) is stamped to
#      $STATUS_FILE as JSON — see write_status() — surfaced by `kortix
#      self-host status` and the `report`/`status` subcommands below.
#   4. Drift (declared version vs. what's actually running) is detected
#      explicitly, both as a post-run log check (check_drift) and on demand
#      via the `report` subcommand.
#   5. Superseded images are pruned after a fully successful run only (never
#      after a degraded one, so a rollback target is never removed), and a
#      disk-space preflight runs before any pull.
#   6. The standing scheduler re-execs this very file from disk whenever it
#      changes on disk, so a CLI-shipped fix reaches an already-running
#      container without a manual recreate.
#   7. A lock file (flock) is shared between the nightly scheduler and a
#      manual `kortix self-host update`/`reconcile` run; the loser reports
#      who currently holds it instead of silently no-op'ing.
#   8. A stateful service (e.g. supabase-db) recreated in place is health-
#      gated post-start with an explicit go/no-go log line, never assumed
#      healthy.
#   9. A short post-swap window watches restart counts for a crash loop and
#      stamps a failed/degraded outcome (with a one-line manual rollback
#      command) instead of reporting false success.
#
# Written in POSIX sh (not bash): the `docker:cli` base image is Alpine and
# does not ship bash, and installing it on every container start is an
# avoidable dependency. Every construct below runs under Alpine's busybox ash.
