/**
 * Navigation Suspense boundary for /projects/[id].
 *
 * Two jobs, the same two as the sibling boundary at files/loading.tsx:
 *  1. Paint project chrome the instant the click lands, instead of leaving the
 *     previous page frozen while the RSC payload and route chunk arrive.
 *  2. Give Next.js a prefetch target. This route is dynamic — the project layout
 *     awaits cookies() — and for a dynamic route Next.js prefetches only as far
 *     as the nearest loading boundary. Without this file, prefetching this route
 *     is skipped altogether and every click pays a full server round-trip.
 *
 * Deliberately imports nothing: no ProjectHome (composer + SessionWelcome +
 * billing), no UI primitives. Plain markup keeps the prefetched payload small,
 * which is the entire point of the boundary.
 *
 * A `loading.tsx` boundary covers its own segment plus every descendant segment
 * that has no `loading.tsx` of its own. `files/` has one, so it is unaffected.
 * `sessions/`, `sessions/[sessionId]`, `customize/`, and `customize/[section]`
 * do not, so this ProjectHome-shaped skeleton also paints during navigation
 * into a session or into customize. This is known and deliberate, not an
 * oversight — adding a `sessions/loading.tsx` is an explicit non-goal here. If
 * this skeleton ever reads wrong on session navigation, the fix is a
 * `sessions/loading.tsx` that mirrors the session shell's frame instead of
 * ProjectHome's, not a change to this file.
 *
 * The outer container mirrors ProjectHome's root so the handover does not shift
 * layout. project-loading-contract.test.ts pins both properties.
