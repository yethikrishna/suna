/**
 * The session route's tab title lives here, and only here.
 *
 * It has to be a layout: `page.tsx` is a client component, and a client
 * component cannot export `generateMetadata`. That is also the reason the tab
 * used to read "Kortix – The AI Command Center for Your Company" for every open
 * session — the route declared no title of its own, so it inherited the root
 * default from app/layout.tsx.
 *
 * Resolving it here rather than in a client effect is not a style preference.
 * React re-asserts the metadata-owned <title> element when it commits, after
 * client effects have already run, so a `document.title = …` write during load
 * is reliably overwritten a few milliseconds later. Owning the title through
 * the Metadata API is the only way it survives — and it comes with the initial
 * HTML, so there is no flicker and no hydration mismatch.
 *
 * Next re-runs this for every navigation into a different `sessionId`,
 * including client-side navigation and browser back/forward, so those cases
 * need no extra machinery.
