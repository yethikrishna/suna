/**
 * Why `ensureFirstProject` resolved to null instead of a project. `/projects`
 * is a redirect back to `../start/page.tsx` (Task 21) — there is no list
 * surface left to explain any of these to the user, so this route has to say
 * so itself, and the three causes need different words:
 *  - `suppressed`    — the user CAN create, but just archived their last
 *    workspace, so the one-shot guard held auto-provision back on purpose.
 *  - `no-permission` — the user CANNOT create at all (member without
 *    PROJECT_CREATE). A create button here would just 403.
 *  - `blocked`       — the user CAN create, but this navigation didn't prove
 *    enough intent for `navigationMayCreateProject` (a cross-site link with
 *    no recent sign-in). Vanishingly rare in practice; worded generically
 *    rather than guessing at "you archived it", which would be false here.
 *
 * Extracted into its own module (mirrors `prompt-from-search-params.ts` in
 * `../[id]/`) so `classifyLandingTerminal` and `ProjectStartEmpty` are
 * testable as plain functions, and so `page.tsx` keeps only the special
 * exports Next.js's App Router expects from a route file.

/**
 * The terminal surface for "nothing to open, nothing to auto-create". Plain
 * centered text, same recipe as `page.tsx`'s `ProjectStartError` — no
 * `InfoBanner`, no second card (`card.tsx`'s surface is transparent/borderless
 * by design; two earlier rounds of this feature already had to remove nested
 * surfaces).
 *
 * Only `suppressed` and `blocked` get a way out: manually clicking through to
 * `/new` is always a real user action, so it's unaffected by the
 * `navigationMayCreateProject` referrer gate that held back the AUTOMATIC
 * provision here. `no-permission` gets no button — a create control that
 * only 403s is worse than none.
