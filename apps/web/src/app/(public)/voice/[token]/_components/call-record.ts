/**
 * Turning `voice_call_turns` rows into something a person can read — and
 * keeping the live LiveKit tail from repeating what the record already holds.
 *
 * Pure, no React, no network: the rules here are the whole reason the call
 * page was wrong before, so they are the part that has to be testable on its
 * own (call-record.test.ts).
 *
 * THE ROLE/SPEAKER RULES, in one place. A row's `role` alone does not say who
 * said it, because `agent` covers two different actors:
 *
 *   role=user                    → a human in the room.
 *   role=agent, speaker=kortix   → the KORTIX agent putting words into the call
 *                                  (apps/api channels/voice/utterance.ts's
 *                                  KORTIX_SPEAKER).
 *   role=agent, speaker=<other>  → the voice itself, labelled with the bot's
 *                                  display name by the worker
 *                                  (apps/voice-agent/src/transcripts.ts).
 *   role=tool                    → an MCP call the voice made; `speaker` is the
 *                                  tool name and nobody spoke.
 *
 * Reading `role` without `speaker` is exactly how the Kortix agent's own lines
 * end up indistinguishable from the voice's — do not collapse these.
