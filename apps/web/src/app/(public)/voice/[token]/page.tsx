/**
 * The voice room page.
 *
 * A human opens this link directly in their own browser — `voice_spawn` mints
 * the token and hands out the URL, nothing renders it on their behalf. It used
 * to be a raw WebSocket pipe that hand-rolled PCM framing, a ring buffer and
 * reconnect logic; all of that is gone now that the room itself is a LiveKit
 * room. This page's only job is to join it: publish the mic, play whatever the
 * agent publishes back, and render the call — live transcript, who's in the
 * room, who's talking, and real controls. Jitter buffering, packet-loss
 * concealment, Opus encode/decode and reconnects are LiveKit's problem now,
 * not ours.
 *
 * The STT/LLM/TTS pipeline lives server-side (the LiveKit agent worker); this
 * page only *subscribes* to what it publishes — the transcription stream and
 * the audio track — because this code runs in a browser with its token
 * visible in the URL. That token is a room-scoped LiveKit access token and
 * nothing else — it authorises joining one room as one participant, not
 * calling the Kortix API.
 *
 * TWO SOURCES FEED THE TRANSCRIPT, and which one is authoritative matters:
 *
 *   - `kortix.voice_call_turns`, polled from
 *     `/v1/public/voice-join/:token/transcript`, IS the transcript. It holds
 *     every spoken turn on both sides, everything the KORTIX agent put into
 *     the call from outside it (`send_prompt`, a finished turn's result, an
 *     error), and every MCP tool call the voice made (`ask_kortix`,
 *     `run_command`).
 *   - LiveKit's client-side `TranscriptionReceived` is a LIVE TAIL on the end
 *     of it, nothing more.
 *
 * This page used to render only the second one, which is why it showed a call
 * with holes in it: that stream carries the two voices in this room and
 * nothing else, so the Kortix agent's own lines and every tool call were
 * missing entirely — they are written server-side and never reach the
 * browser's LiveKit connection at all. The tail is still worth having, but
 * only for latency: it shows a sentence the instant it is spoken, and drops
 * out again as soon as the same words land in the durable record
 * (`unrecordedLive`), so nothing is ever shown twice or silently lost.
 *
 * The record endpoint is authorised by the join link itself — the same
 * capability, the same revocation-on-`endCall`, scoped server-side to the one
 * call the link was minted for. No logged-in user, and nothing project- or
 * session-wide is reachable from it.
 *
 * The URL's last path segment is now one of TWO shapes, and this page tells
 * them apart by prefix (`isJoinLinkToken`) before doing anything else:
 *   - `vjl_...` — a short, ungessable, server-resolved join-link token
 *     (join-links.ts). This page exchanges it for a freshly-minted LiveKit
 *     access token + server URL via `getPublicVoiceJoin` (the public,
 *     unauthenticated `GET /v1/public/voice-join/:token`) and never sees the
 *     `?url=` query param at all.
 *   - anything else — the LEGACY shape: the raw LiveKit access token itself,
 *     with the server URL riding in `?url=`. `voice_spawn` stopped minting
 *     these (a ~300-char JWT in a URL is fragile in transit — one corrupted
 *     character breaks the signature with no way to retry), but a link
 *     already handed out under the old scheme still has to open, so this
 *     path is kept rather than removed.
 *
 * Live-tested 2026-07-25 in a real Google Meet-adjacent call (this page open in
 * its own tab, no third-party meeting bot involved): no audible self-echo and
 * barge-in worked, with no explicit echoCancellation/noiseSuppression/
 * autoGainControl constraints set — see the plain `setMicrophoneEnabled(true)`
 * call below. If a browser/OS combination ever does produce audible self-echo,
 * this is where a half-duplex mute or explicit AEC constraints would go.
 *
 * Audio only — the agent never publishes a video track, so this page never
 * renders one either. Presence is shown as avatar tiles, not blank camera
 * rects standing in for a video call that isn't happening.
