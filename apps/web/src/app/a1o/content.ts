/**
 * Copy for /a1o — "all in one". Six layers of the Kortix stack, one per face of
 * a die you roll around the table. Whichever face lands up is the layer shown.
 *
 * `slot` is the die face this layer is printed on. Slots are laid out so that
 * opposite faces sum to seven, the way a real die is arranged — DIE_FACES in
 * die-scene.tsx binds each slot to a face normal.
 *
 * The word printed on the die is derived from `title`, never stored separately:
 * two independent strings drifted apart once already (a face reading TRUST
 * while the copy read Governance).
 *
 * HONESTY RULES (same bar as features/marketing/security/content.ts):
 * - SOC 2 Type II is IN PROGRESS. Never "compliant" / "certified" until the
 *   report lands.
 * - Do NOT advertise multi-harness / harness-agnostic / ACP. OpenCode REST +
 *   kortix_version 2 is the only shipped path (see CLAUDE.md).
