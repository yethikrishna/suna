// Single source of truth for how project roles are described in the UI.
//
// Marko's feedback: "No understanding of Viewer/Editor/Manager role in a
// project. What does a viewer in a project do?" — fair. The labels alone
// don't tell you anything, and we used to scatter the explanation across
// a help popover, a tooltip, and developer documentation. This file
// collapses that into one descriptor per role so every Select, popover,
// and badge pulls from the same copy.
//
// Keep the `blurb` short enough to fit under a Select option (one line on
// a 320px dropdown). Use `summary` for popovers / longer surfaces.
//
// The capability lists below mirror the role → action mapping in
// apps/api/src/iam/role-perms.ts. If you change one, change the other.
