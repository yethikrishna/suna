/**
 * Save a batch of tool API keys, returning which succeeded and which failed.
 *
 * Extracted from the onboarding setup wizard so the success/failure aggregation
 * can be unit-tested. The previous inline loop swallowed every error with
 * `.catch(() => {})`, ignored the HTTP status, and then reported success
 * unconditionally — so a fully-failed save still showed "N keys saved".
 *
 * `put` resolves `{ ok }` for an HTTP-level result; a thrown error (e.g. a
 * network failure) is treated as a failure for that key.
