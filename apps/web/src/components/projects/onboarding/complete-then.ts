/**
 * Finish onboarding, then tell the host — whether or not the finish actually
 * persisted.
 *
 * Extracted from `ProjectOnboardingWizard` rather than inlined so this rule is
 * testable at all: the wizard cannot be rendered in `apps/web`'s test harness
 * (no jsdom, and `mock.module('@tanstack/react-query', …)` would be
 * process-wide across a non---isolate `bun test` run), so an inline
 * try/catch would be provable only by reading it.
 *
 * The swallow is deliberate and is the point of the function. `complete()`
 * PATCHes `metadata.onboarding_completed_at`; the wizard is a fullscreen
 * modal with no close button and no outside-click dismiss. If a failed stamp
 * skipped the notify, the user would be sealed in that modal by a network
 * blip. The failure mode we accept instead is one extra wizard render the
 * next time they open the workspace.
