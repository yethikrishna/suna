/**
 * Saves are fire-and-forget by design: a failed survey write must never block
 * navigation and must never raise a toast. The user asked to advance a step,
 * not to save a form.
 *
 * These are source-shape assertions. The properties being protected are
 * "persists through the SDK" and "swallows failures" — both are about what the
 * module is allowed to contain, and both would be trivially satisfiable by a
 * rendering test that never exercises the failure path.
