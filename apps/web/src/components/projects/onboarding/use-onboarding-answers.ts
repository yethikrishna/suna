 * Holds the survey answers locally and mirrors each one to the server as it is
 * given, so a user who abandons onboarding at the tools step still leaves their
 * use case and company behind. Waiting until the finish step would throw away
 * every partial answer, which is most of them.
 *
 * Saves are deliberately fire-and-forget. A failed profile write must not block
 * navigation and must not raise a toast: the user asked to advance a step, not
 * to save a form. The answer is lost; the onboarding is not.
