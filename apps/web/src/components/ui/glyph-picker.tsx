/**
 * Glyph grid for picking a project icon. Same geometry contract as
 * `emoji-picker.tsx` on purpose: `h-[368px]`, 9 columns of `size-8` cells in
 * rows padded `px-1.5`. `project-icon-field.tsx` sizes the popover to that
 * exact width (9 * 8 + 2 * 1.5 spacing units); a different column count or a
 * different fixed height changes the popover's geometry the moment the Icon
 * tab is selected, so both numbers are copied here, not re-derived.
 *
 * glyph-picker.test.tsx checks those same four literals — `size-8`, `px-1.5`,
 * `grid-cols-9`, `h-[368px]` — but never against THIS raw, commented file: the
 * three grid classes are asserted against `renderToStaticMarkup` output (real
 * shipped DOM, no comments exist there at all), and the height comparison
 * strips every block and line comment out of both this file and
 * emoji-picker.tsx before matching. A doc comment repeating these class
 * names — like this one — is deliberately safe to write and cannot make
 * either test pass or fail.
 *
 * All 202 catalogue glyphs render in ONE `grid-cols-9`, in
 * `PROJECT_GLYPH_NAMES`'s declaration order — no category headers. This
 * shipped with an 8-category sub-grid (sticky header per category) first;
 * review feedback was that the categories added scannable structure but no
 * function — nothing filters, sorts, or navigates by category — so they were
 * cut. `PROJECT_GLYPH_GROUPS` (in `@kortix/shared`) still owns the grouping
 * and the ordering; `PROJECT_GLYPH_NAMES` is that same catalogue flattened in
 * declaration order, so related glyphs stay adjacent even with the headers
 * gone. Flattening it a second time here, instead of importing the flat
 * export, would risk a reordering that drifts from the shared source.
 *
 * The grid IS the colour preview: every cell paints in `color`, not just the
 * one the user last picked. Clicking a swatch re-tints the whole grid and
 * leaves the popover open — colour is a modifier you can change your mind
 * about. Clicking a glyph commits `{ name, color }` and closes it — the glyph
 * is the choice. That asymmetry is deliberate, not an oversight.
 *
 * Unlike an emoji cell (tinted only while `data-active`, via frimousse's
 * pointer/keyboard tracking), a glyph cell carries its colour in TWO layers:
 * the icon itself is tinted at rest (`glyphForeground`, so the preview reads
 * before you ever touch the grid), and the fill + 1px inset ring appear only
 * on hover (`glyphTintHover` + a local ring map below) — the same tile
 * treatment an emoji cell shows on `data-active`, so hovering either tab reads
 * as the same surface.
 */

/**
 * Hover-only ring colour, one literal class per palette colour.
 *
 * `glyph-tint.ts` exports the REST tile (`glyphTint`: fill + ring, always on —
 * built for a host like the project-icon trigger button that stays tinted
 * once an icon is picked) and the hover FILL restated on its own
 * (`glyphTintHover`, for fighting a host variant's `hover:bg-*`). Neither is a
 * hover-scoped RING. A glyph cell here has no rest-state tile at all — only
 * the tinted icon — so the ring has to be introduced fresh, hover-scoped, and
 * it has to stay a literal string per colour: Tailwind v4 extracts class names
 * by scanning source TEXT, so gluing a `hover:` prefix onto a helper's return
 * value at runtime would compile to nothing.

            the glyph you're about to pick, decided before you scan the grid,
            so it reads as part of the search header, not a trailing readout.
            No `border-t` — that rule separated a footer from the content
            above it; this row now shares the header block with the search
            field and takes its `space-y-2` rhythm instead. Dropping the
            footer's fixed `h-11` hands that height back to the scrollable
            grid below.

            `glyphTint` (the REST tile, not the hover-only variant used in the
            grid below) belongs here: a swatch IS a persistent colour
            indicator, not a hover preview, so it wears its own colour's fill
            + ring at all times. The selected swatch adds a checkmark rather
            than a thicker ring — that keeps every swatch's ring at the same
            1px `glyphTint` already draws, so the row doesn't shift geometry
            when the selection changes. */}
