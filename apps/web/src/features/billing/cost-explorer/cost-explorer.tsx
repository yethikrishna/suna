 * instant a preset resolves against, and reads no ambient state of its own
 * (no Next.js hooks, no clock), so it is testable without a router and its
 * output is a function of its inputs alone.
 *
 * `now` is a required parameter, not a `new Date()` default, deliberately.
 * This function runs in a render body; a default would let a caller re-read
 * the clock on every render, and both bounds it returns land inside four React
 * Query keys. A window that moves by a millisecond per render mints a new key
 * per render, and since no cost query carries `placeholderData`, every new key
 * is a cache miss that fetches — and that fetch re-renders, so it does not
 * settle. Request count then grows linearly with time on the page for as long
 * as the tab is open.
 *
 * Unbounded is the claim; a rate is not. The one bound that holds everywhere is
 * `Date`'s 1 ms resolution — two renders inside the same millisecond produce an
 * identical `to` and no new key — so no environment exceeds ~1000 cycles/s. The
 * rate in a browser has NOT been measured and no mechanism for it is asserted
 * here. Note the cycle is not gated on responses: react-query notifies when a
 * fetch STARTS, so a slow endpoint does not slow the loop down.
 * `useExplorerClockAnchor` below is what supplies a `now` that holds still.
 *
 * A named preset (`24h`/`7d`/`30d`/`90d`) is resolved against `now` — the
 * window is relative to when the link is opened, not frozen at the moment it
 * was shared. A `custom` range instead carries its own explicit `from`/`to`,
 * so it never consults `now` at all and was always stable.
 *
 * Guard: a `session` without a `project` is ignored. Level 3 (the session
 * ledger) has no way to resolve its parent breadcrumb crumb without a
 * project id, so a URL edited (or bookmarked) into that half-formed shape
 * falls back to level 1 instead of rendering broken.

 *    the exact defect this explorer exists to remove.
 *  - **Back would never hit cache.** Returning to the projects level would mint
 *    keys nobody has fetched, so Back means skeletons rather than the instant
 *    restore it implies. `staleTime` cannot help — a new key is a new `Query`
 *    with no data in it.

/**
 * The instant this explorer's presets resolve against: read once per range

 *
 * Why held at all: a preset is a window relative to now, so "now" has to be
 * re-read *sometime* or a long-lived tab keeps reporting a stale window. Every
 * render is far too often — that is the defect this replaces, a request loop
 * rather than a slow drift. `explorerClockKey` above decides the "sometime":
 * an explicit range change, or a reload. Not a drill-down, and not Back.
 *
 * Why not quantize instead: flooring `to` to the minute or hour lowers the rate
 * the key changes at, it does not stop the key changing. Every boundary
 * crossing still re-keys and refetches every mounted query, so a dashboard
 * someone is reading blanks into skeletons on a timer — and the grain is the
 * only thing holding it back, since flooring to a grain near the render cadence
 * restores the loop in full (320 requests per 150 ms at a 1 ms grain, against
 * 324 unfloored). A failure that appears at unpredictable moments is worse than
 * a constant one, because only the constant one shows up in a local run.
 * Holding the reading removes the moving input rather than sampling it slower.
 *
 * Why derived state rather than `useMemo` or a ref. All three work; the
 * argument is about what each one costs, and it is narrower than it looks:
 *
 *  - `useMemo` would very probably be fine. React documents its cache as a hint
 *    it may discard, but it has never actually done so outside a hidden
 *    `<Activity>` tree, and StrictMode's second pass reuses it. A discard here
 *    would also NOT restore the loop: it costs one extra clock read and one
 *    refetch, the same price already accepted for a concurrent render below.
 *    Looping would need a discard on *every* render. So "the memo might be
 *    dropped" is a real but small cost, not the catastrophe it first looks.
 *  - A ref would work too, but writing `ref.current` during render is against
 *    React's documented rules. It goes unflagged here only because this repo
 *    pins `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@5.2.0` with `exhaustive-deps` as its one
 *    enabled rule and React Compiler is off — `react-hooks/refs` in v6 would
 *    flag it, and the compiler bails out of any component that does it. Buying
 *    a guarantee with a compiler bailout is a bad trade.
 *  - `useState` gives the retention guarantee outright (state is never
 *    discarded) with no rule to bend, and adjusting it during render is a
 *    documented React pattern for exactly this — a value that has to reset when
 *    an input changes. So: no memo semantics to rely on, no compiler bailout.
 *
 * State starts as `null` rather than a lazily-initialized reading so that
 * `nextClockAnchor` is the file's ONE clock read — every path, mount included,
 * goes through the same gate, and "this file reads the clock exactly once" is
 * a thing a test can assert outright.
 *
 * It takes the raw `URLSearchParams` and calls `explorerClockKey` itself rather
 * than accepting a prepared key. A key parameter is a seam a caller can widen
 * — `useExplorerClockAnchor(explorerClockKey(p) + p.get('project'))` type-checks
 * and silently restores the per-drill-down re-read this exists to prevent.
 * Owning the derivation makes that unrepresentable instead of merely tested.
 *
 * `nextClockAnchor` returns the held object unless the key changed, so
 * `setHeld` is reached on mount and on a real range change, and nowhere else.
 * React then re-renders this component immediately, before its children; that
 * second pass sees the matching key and stops. Both passes return the same,
 * correct anchor, so no child ever renders against a stale window.
 *
 * This cannot spin: the key comes from the URL, and nothing a query returns can
 * change the URL. A key that cannot move on its own is what bounds this
 * structurally rather than by convention.
 *
 * Exported for its own tests. `renderToStaticMarkup` runs React's real
 * render-phase update loop, so the holding, the two-pass settle and the single
 * child render are all assertable directly — see `cost-explorer.test.tsx`.
