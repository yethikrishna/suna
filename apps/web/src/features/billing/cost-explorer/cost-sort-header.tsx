 * to the sort tokens their route accepts and leave the rest as plain
 * `TableHead`s.
 *
 * The control is a real `<button>` INSIDE the `<th>`, not a click handler on
 * the `<th>` itself: a `<th>` is not focusable, gets no Enter/Space handling,
 * and cannot take a focus ring — so a handler there is a mouse-only control.
 *
 * `-my-2 py-2` gives the button the row's full height as its hit area while
 * cancelling its own padding, so the header row's density is unchanged.
