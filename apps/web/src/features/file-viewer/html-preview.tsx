/**
 * `HtmlPreview` — an HTML file, shown the only way an HTML file can be shown.
 *
 * A page is not its markup. It is that markup plus everything the markup points
 * at — `./styles.css`, `img/hero.png`, `app.js` — and every one of those is a
 * URL resolved against the document's own. Handing the text to an iframe as
 * `srcDoc` gives the document NO url (`about:srcdoc`, opaque origin), so none of
 * those references can resolve and the page arrives as unstyled text. There is
 * no attribute that fixes that; the file has to be served.
 *
 * The sandbox already ships the server that does it — the static file server on
 * port 3211. `useStaticFilePreview` owns reaching it (the proxied URL, the
 * preview session, and the wait while a sandbox boots); this component owns the
 * three things a user sees while that happens.
 *
 * Used by every surface that previews an HTML file, so the Easy panel and the
 * files viewer cannot drift into two different answers about what an HTML file
 * looks like.
