/**
 * Exported as `RuntimeMark`, not `OpenCode` — `scripts/sdk-boundary.mjs`
 * (run via `sdk-boundary.test.ts` against `sdk-boundary-baseline.json`) flags
 * any import specifier whose *source* name contains "opencode",
 * case-insensitively and regardless of which module it comes from, to stop
 * apps/web reaching into the OpenCode runtime SDK. That scan is independent
 * of (and stricter than) eslint's `no-restricted-syntax` rule, which is now
 * scoped to `@kortix/sdk`/opencode-ish sources and no longer flags this file
 * — but sdk-boundary.mjs still would. `RuntimeMark` mirrors the SDK's own
 * convention for this exact rename (`ProjectOpenCodeSession as
 * ProjectRuntimeSession` in `packages/sdk/src/index.ts`), not "Harness":
 * this codebase already uses "harness" for the pluggable-agent-runtime
 * concept (OpenCode vs. the Claude Code / Codex / Pi harnesses behind
 * `KORTIX_ACP_RUNTIME`), so reusing it here for an unrelated brand mark
 * would collide with a real domain term. Import this as `import { RuntimeMark
 * as OpenCode } from '@/features/icon/icons/open-code'` to keep call sites
 * unchanged.
