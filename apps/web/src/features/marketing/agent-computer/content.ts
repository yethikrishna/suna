/**
 * `/agent-computer` copy.
 *
 * Plain English lives here, not in `apps/web/translations/*.json`, so the copy
 * can iterate before paying the 8-locale parity gate (`pnpm i18n:translations`).
 * Wire i18n keys only once the copy is locked.
 *
 * Voice rules: the `comms` skill.
 * ACCURACY GATE for this page specifically:
 *  - Say "agent computer" / "cloud computer" / "sandbox". NEVER "container".
 *  - "3,000+ apps" is the only sanctioned number. No benchmarks, no latency,
 *    no uptime, no customer names.
 *  - NEVER claim blanket "microVM isolation". Platinum is a Cloud Hypervisor
 *    microVM; Daytona, the default provider, is not. Write "its own isolated
 *    machine" and name the provider where the distinction matters — the same
 *    rule `features/marketing/security-page/content.ts` follows.
 *  - NEVER write that a secret is "never shown to the model". A granted runtime
 *    secret is a real env value in the session, readable by any command the
 *    agent runs (docs/ENV_SECRET_EXPOSURE_BASELINE.md). CONNECTOR credentials
 *    are the ones that never enter the machine.
 *  - Never claim a certification. Never name a licence — "open source" and stop.
 *  - Nothing merges itself: work reaches `main` through a change request a
 *    person approves. Never write "deploys" for an agent's output.
