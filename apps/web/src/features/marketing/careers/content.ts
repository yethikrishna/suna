/**
 * `/careers` copy. The page is a job board, not an essay: the openings, the
 * bar, and how to apply. Nothing else belongs here — the thesis lives on
 * `/about`.
 *
 * Plain English lives here, not in `apps/web/translations/*.json`, so the copy
 * can iterate before paying the 8-locale parity gate (`pnpm i18n:translations`).
 *
 * Voice rules: the `comms` skill. The bar is distilled from `CLAUDE.md`.
 *
 * ACCURACY GATE for this page specifically:
 *  - INVENT NOTHING about employment. No salary band, no equity, no benefits,
 *    no headcount, no remote policy. The only two locations are **Belgrade,
 *    Serbia** and **San Francisco**; every opening is open in both, and no
 *    third location may be added.
 *  - The five openings are the founder's own list. Every bullet under them
 *    comes from him. Keep them short — a spec belongs in a conversation.
 *  - Applications go through `ApplyModal`, which posts to the same
 *    `/api/demo-request` pipeline as "Book your demo". There is no ATS and no
 *    jobs@ alias — do not invent one. The three direct links (email, X,
 *    LinkedIn) are the ones this page already carried.
 *  - There is NO file upload on that pipeline (JSON in, one blob into
 *    `contact_forms`). Ask for a LINK to a CV or portfolio. Never promise an
 *    attachment.
 *  - Naming opencode / Codex / Claude Code / Pi under Product / Eng describes
 *    ecosystem fluency wanted in a CANDIDATE. It must never read as a claim
 *    that Kortix supports those harnesses. OpenCode is the Kortix harness, and
 *    the same opening says so.
 *  - Competitor names, exactly: **Claude Cowork** (one word, lowercase `w`) and
 *    **ChatGPT Work** (two words).
 *  - Never name a licence — "open source" and stop. Never claim a certification.
 *  - No culture-page filler. If a sentence restates the one above it, cut it.
