/**
 * `/company-as-code` copy.
 *
 * Plain English lives here, not in `apps/web/translations/*.json`, so the copy
 * can iterate before paying the 8-locale parity gate (`pnpm i18n:translations`).
 * Wire i18n keys only once the copy is locked.
 *
 * Voice rules: the `comms` skill.
 * ACCURACY GATE for this page specifically:
 *  - Every line of YAML, every path and every CLI command on this page is real.
 *    Ground truth: `packages/starter/templates/base/kortix.yaml`, the same
 *    template's `.kortix/` tree, `packages/manifest-schema/src/index.v2.ts`,
 *    and `apps/web/content/docs/project/manifest.mdx`. Do not invent a field.
 *  - `channels:` is NOT a manifest key in schema version 2 — the validator
 *    rejects it. Channel routing is live project state; connecting a channel
 *    creates a `connectors` entry with `provider: channel`. Never show a
 *    `channels:` block here.
 *  - `env.required` / `env.optional` and `agents.<name>.secrets` are secret
 *    NAMES and GRANTS. Secret values never appear in the repo. Say so.
 *  - Say "agent computer" / "cloud computer" / "sandbox". NEVER "container".
 *  - Never claim a certification. Never name a licence — "open source" and stop.
 *  - No invented metrics, no customer names. Northwind is a placeholder.
 *  - The harness is OpenCode. Nothing else is shipped.
 *  - Nothing merges itself: work reaches `main` through a change request a
 *    person approves. Never write "deploys" for an agent's output.
