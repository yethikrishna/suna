/**
 * `/download` copy.
 *
 * Plain English lives here, not in `apps/web/translations/*.json`, so copy can
 * iterate before paying the 8-locale parity gate. Same precedent as
 * `features/marketing/self-hosted/content.ts`.
 *
 * ACCURACY GATE — every string below is checked against the live GitHub release
 * (v0.11.0, 2026-07-28), not against docs:
 *  1. macOS ships ONE universal .dmg. Never advertise separate Apple Silicon
 *     and Intel desktop builds — they do not exist.
 *  2. Linux desktop is x86_64 ONLY. There is no arm64 AppImage. The row says so
 *     rather than letting an ARM visitor download a binary that will not run.
 *  3. There is NO Windows CLI binary. The install script is bash-only, so the
 *     terminal block says "macOS & Linux · WSL on Windows".
 *  4. There is no Chrome extension in this repo — no manifest, no app. The page
 *     must not advertise one, not even as "coming soon".
 *  5. NEITHER mobile app is publicly installable. iOS is on TestFlight and
 *     Android is on a Play internal track, so both store URLs are dead ends for
 *     the public. The rows carry a status instead of a link — see MOBILE_ROWS.
