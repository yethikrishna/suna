 * One product card: full-bleed image, header, then a divided list of platform
 * rows. Row anatomy is taken from the Perplexity download page.
 *
 * The card element carries NO padding. It hosts flush children — the image and
 * the row seams — so padding lives on the slots instead. That is what lets each
 * `border-t` run edge to edge rather than floating inside a gutter.
 *
 * `overflow-hidden` on the card also removes any concentric-radius problem: the
 * image and the first row are clipped by the card's own `rounded-md`, so no
 * child needs to restate it.
 *
 * Flat by law: border, never a shadow. In-flow surfaces do not float.
 *
 * `filled` names the one row rendered solid. Every other button on the page is
 * `outline`. Exactly one solid button exists per page and it is the visitor's
 * own platform — that is the entire recommendation UI, and it is why a
 * non-technical visitor never has to read a comparison table.
