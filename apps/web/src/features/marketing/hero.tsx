     navbar already follows (`mx-auto w-full max-w-7xl px-6`). Splitting them —
     px-6 on the section, max-w-7xl on the inner containers — puts the padding
     outside the centred box instead of inside it, so once the viewport is wider
     than max-w-7xl the hero content starts 24px left of the navbar's and the H1
     hangs off the logo. Below max-w-7xl the two happen to agree, which is why it
     only shows on desktop. Every max-w-7xl container below therefore carries its
     own px-6. */

       navbar — top-heavy and cramped at the same time. `min-h-svh` plus
       `justify-center` splits the slack above and below instead, and the top
       padding is the floor that keeps the eyebrow clear of the fixed navbar
       (67px) at every height. */
