/**
 * Layer 03 — the model is a SLOT, and the slot is yours.
 *
 * THE FORM, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE
 *
 * Every panel in this section had to find a shape native to its own claim, and
 * no two may share one — the section reads as a single argument, and an
 * argument made six times in the same diagram is a template. Taken already:
 * `source-of-truth` is a schematic, `connectors` is a wall of tiles, `computer`
 * is a chat transcript, `control-plane` is a review queue. So this is none of
 * those. It is a CONTROL.
 *
 * That is not a stylistic dodge, it is the honest reading of the layer. The
 * claim here is not "we integrate with these vendors" — every tool says that,
 * and a list is how every tool says it. The claim is that the model is one
 * field with a value in it, that the value is swappable per agent, per session,
 * per message, and that swapping it costs you nothing because the key was never
 * ours to begin with. A field with a value in it is a control. So the panel is
 * the control, at rest, changing its own value while you watch.
 *
 * The motion carries the whole argument and there is very little of it: the
 * indicator slides, the value swaps. Two moving things. A reader who looks away
 * and back has lost nothing, which is the test an ambient loop has to pass.
 *
 * ACCURACY GATE — checked against shipped code, not the manifesto:
 *   - The custom-provider form takes any base URL and drives it through
 *     `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`, which is why vLLM / LiteLLM / Ollama are ONE
 *     entry and not three logos we do not integrate with.
 *   - The ChatGPT row is the Codex device-grant OAuth
 *     (`apps/api/src/projects/codex-device-auth.ts`) and is real. Cursor is NOT
 *     — there is no Cursor auth path anywhere in the codebase, however often a
 *     README says otherwise. Never add it.
 *   - Model FAMILIES only, never version numbers. This panel has no build step
 *     that would catch a stale one, and a marketing page naming `opus-4.7` is
 *     wrong within the month.
 *   - The value only ever settles on a CONNECTED provider. Showing a session
 *     resolved to an endpoint nobody has wired up animates a claim the demo has
 *     not earned.
