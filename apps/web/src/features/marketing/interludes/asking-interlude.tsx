/**
 * Interlude 1 — sits between the use-case wheel and the open-source slab.
 *
 * WHAT IT FIXES. The wheel above it is entirely OUTPUT: ten finished artifacts,
 * a spreadsheet, a diff, an unsent draft. The page never once shows the INPUT,
 * so a reader watches ten results go past with no idea what a person did to get
 * any of them. That is why the cards land without follow-through. This is the
 * missing half — the sentence somebody typed — and it is also the rest between
 * the pinned wheel and the slab that follows it.
 *
 * WHY THE PANEL IS TEXT, NOT A SCREENSHOT. Kortix has real product footage
 * (`public/media/showcase/`), and the hero already uses it. A second video here
 * would be the opposite of a quiet section. What the panel shows instead is the
 * one thing that is honest to render as markup: the words a person types. It
 * deliberately draws no chat window, no send button and no product chrome,
 * because none of that would be a picture of anything real.
 *
 * ONE PROMPT PER MODE, NOT THREE. The point is the difference between the three
 * modes, and a reader gets that from one example each. More would turn the
 * quiet section into a list to work through.
 *
 * Copy, and the accuracy gate every line of it had to pass, live in
 * `content.ts`. Read that file before editing a word here.
