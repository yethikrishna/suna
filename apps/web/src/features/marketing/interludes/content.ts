/**
 * Home-page interlude copy — the two quiet sections.
 *
 * Plain English lives here, not in `apps/web/translations/*.json`, so the copy
 * can iterate before paying the 8-locale parity gate (`pnpm i18n:translations`).
 * Wire i18n keys only once the copy is locked.
 *
 * Voice rules: the `comms` skill.
 *
 * WHY THESE EXIST. The back half of the home page is four opinionated surfaces
 * in a row — a pinned wheel of cards, a bordered slab, a dark trust card, a
 * gridded CTA card — landing back to back with nothing between them. Each one
 * is a different shape and a different weight, so the page stops reading as a
 * sequence and starts reading as a stack of unrelated blocks. These two are the
 * rest between them: ordinary two-column text-and-graphic sections, one with
 * the graphic right and one with it left, deliberately the calmest things on
 * the page.
 *
 * WHY THEY ARE NOT THE PASSAGES. `features/marketing/capabilities` is the dense
 * read — four prose passages, each indexing a sub-page, each mounted on its own
 * elsewhere on this page. These two carry no link at all and roughly a third of
 * the words, and they are two-column with a bordered panel where a passage is a
 * single narrow document with a mono rail. They are breathing room, and the
 * moment either one starts arguing a whole capability it has stopped doing its
 * job.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * ACCURACY GATE — checked against code and against the shipped starter
 * (`packages/starter/templates/base`), not against marketing copy. Do not
 * soften, inflate, or "restore" any of it.
 * ==========================================================================
 *  - AGENTS. An agent is an OpenCode agent. Markdown is the baseline — the
 *    starter's `.kortix/opencode/agents/kortix.md` carries real OpenCode
 *    frontmatter (`mode: primary`, `permission: allow`) — and the whole
 *    OpenCode lifecycle sits in the same directory: tools, plugins, skills,
 *    commands, models. Never reduce an agent to "a markdown file".
 *  - HARNESS. OpenCode is the only one. ACP, `kortix_version: 3` and the
 *    Claude Code / Codex / Pi harnesses sit behind `KORTIX_ACP_RUNTIME`
 *    (default false) and are not shipped. Never name them.
 *  - GRANTS. `kortix.yaml` states it outright: "Omitted grants resolve to
 *    `none` in this schema version. Grant explicitly." That is the claim made
 *    below, in those words.
 *  - MERGE is default-deny for AGENTS, not human-only — `project.cr.merge` is
 *    a grantable capability. APPROVAL GATES ARE OFF BY DEFAULT
 *    (`policy.default_mode` falls back to `allow_all`), so never write that the
 *    agent asks before acting as a default. The three answers are exactly
 *    allow / ask / block (`apps/api/src/connectors/policy.ts`).
 *  - THE TREE below is the real shipped starter layout, read from
 *    `packages/starter/templates/base`. Do not add a directory it does not
 *    have, and do not show a `channels:` key in `kortix.yaml` — the v2 manifest
 *    validator REJECTS it. Channel routing is live project state, exactly as
 *    the shipped manifest's own closing comment says.
 *  - SURFACES. Slack, web and CLI only. Slack is the one live channel; Teams is
 *    behind an operator switch and email/voice are experimental. The manifest
 *    enum is closed at four. Telegram, WhatsApp, SMS and Discord are NOT
 *    channels, in any tense.
 *  - TRIGGERS are exactly two kinds: a cron schedule and a signed webhook.
 *  - NO METRICS anywhere in this file. The only sanctioned figure on the site
 *    is the live GitHub star count, and it belongs to the open-source section.
 *  - NO CUSTOMER NAMES, ever. Neither prompt below names a company.
 *  - Never name a licence. Never claim a certification. Say "cloud computer" or
 *    "its own machine" — never "container", and never a blanket "microVM"
 *    (true for the Platinum provider only).
