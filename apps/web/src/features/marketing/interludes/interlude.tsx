/**
 * The shared shell both interludes are built on.
 *
 * WHY ONE SHELL. The two sections only do their job — restoring rhythm to the
 * back half of the page — if a reader recognises them as the same species the
 * second time round. Identical measure, identical column split, identical
 * spacing; the single difference is which side the graphic sits on. Two
 * bespoke layouts would have read as two more one-off surfaces, which is the
 * problem, not the fix.
 *
 * WHY 5 / 7. The text column is capped near a 60-character measure at this
 * width, which is where prose stays readable; the panel takes the wider half
 * because a file tree and a set of quoted sentences both need horizontal room
 * before they start wrapping into mush.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SO PLAIN. It sits between a pinned card wheel, a bordered slab, a
 * dark card and a gridded CTA. Anything with its own personality here competes
 * with four surfaces that already have one. There is no shadow, no fill on the
 * section, no accent colour and nothing to interact with — on purpose.
