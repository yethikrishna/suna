/**
 * Interlude 2 — sits between the open-source slab and the trust card, with the
 * graphic on the LEFT so it reads as the answering half of interlude 1.
 *
 * WHAT IT FIXES. Open source, trust and the closing CTA are three heavy
 * surfaces of three different kinds landing back to back. This is the rest
 * between the first two, and it also finishes the argument the slab starts: the
 * slab proves you can run the code, this shows what you are actually holding
 * once you do.
 *
 * WHY A TREE. It is the one graphic on the page that can be rendered honestly
 * without a screenshot, because it is not a picture of a product — it is the
 * literal layout of `packages/starter/templates/base`, which is what a new
 * project ships with. Every path in `content.ts` was read off that directory.
 * If the starter changes, this changes.
 *
 * WHAT IT MUST NOT SHOW. No `channels:` key. The v2 manifest validator rejects
 * it; channel routing is live project state, which the shipped manifest's own
 * closing comment says in as many words. Drawing it here would be a copy bug
 * that teaches people to write a file that fails validation.
 *
 * Copy, and the accuracy gate every line of it had to pass, live in
 * `content.ts`. Read that file before editing a word here.

 * The `├─ │ └─` gutter, derived rather than hand-written.
 *
 * A node is the last child at its level when no later node returns to that
 * depth before the tree pops above it; an ancestor level still needs its
 * vertical guide when some later node does return to it. Computing this from
 * `depth` alone means `content.ts` stays a plain list of paths — nobody has to
 * redraw box characters by hand when a directory is added.
