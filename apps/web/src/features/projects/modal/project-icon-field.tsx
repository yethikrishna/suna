        The width is the emoji grid's exact width, not a round number.
        `EmojiPicker` lays out 9 columns (frimousse 0.3.0's `columns` default;
        the picker passes no override) of `size-8` cells in a row padded
        `px-1.5` — in Tailwind `--spacing` units, 9*8 + 2*1.5 = 75.
        `GlyphPicker`, rendered on the Icon tab inside `ProjectIconPicker`,
        copies the same four literals for exactly this reason — see its own
        file header — so the popover never resizes on tab switch.

        This is a TRADEOFF, not a clean win. It is chosen for the
        overlay-scrollbar case, which is what this app is otherwise built
        against. A frimousse row is a bare flex line with no justification, and
        its `size-8` cells keep the default `flex-shrink: 1`:

        - Overlay scrollbars (macOS default; every measurement below). The 292px
          this file was first written with left 14.03px of surplus on the right
          of every row — the grid's right edge 12.19px short of the search
          field's while its left edge sat 1.84px outside it. At this width the
          surplus is 0.03px and the cells are square.
        - Classic scrollbars (Windows, Linux, macOS "Show scroll bars: Always").
          The viewport loses ~15px. At 292px the surplus absorbs almost all of
          it and each cell gives up ~0.11px, staying square. Here there is no
          surplus, so the whole ~15px comes out of the nine cells — ~1.67px
          each, and they visibly stop being square. This width is WORSE there.
          Not verified on such a platform; the real fix belongs in the picker,
          which owns the scrolling viewport, and is deliberately not made here.

        Beware: putting `scrollbar-gutter: stable` on that viewport would
        reserve the gutter on EVERY platform, so at this width the cells would
        squash everywhere. The geometry tests read column count, cell size and
        row padding from source — none of those change, so they would not catch
        it.

        `w-fit` lands on the same number today and was rejected: it makes the
        popover's geometry an emergent property of everything inside the picker,
        including the `truncate`d active-emoji label in its footer, whose
        intrinsic width is the full untruncated string.

        p-0 because each picker owns its own padding — `p-2` around the search
        field, `px-1.5` on the grid rows, and EmojiPicker's own `px-2` footer
        (GlyphPicker has none; its colour row sits inside the search's `p-2`
        block instead) — PopoverContent's default p-4 would inset it a second
        time.

        Radix gives the content role="dialog"; without a label it is announced
        as an unnamed one.

          It sits under the picker rather than above it because the primary path
