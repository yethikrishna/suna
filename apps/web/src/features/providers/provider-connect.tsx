/**
 * `provider-connect.tsx` — THE provider connect surface. One component, mounted
 * by the Models settings tab (`gateway-view.tsx`'s Providers sub-tab, reached
 * through `features/workspace/settings/tabs/models-tab.tsx`), by the model
 * selector's connect dialog and by the Secrets tab's "Manage providers" button
 * (both through `llm-provider-modal.tsx`'s `ProjectProviderModal`, which is now
 * only a `Modal` shell around this file). JAY-510: a third copy is not
 * acceptable — that is the defect this file exists to remove.
 *
 * **ONE list. No sections.** A search field, one line of instruction, and a
 * row per provider — logo and name on the left, key field on the right. That
 * is the whole screen.
 *
 * **What this replaced, and why.** It had four sections — Connected, Add a
 * key, a "Show 181 more providers" disclosure, and Custom provider — each
 * individually defensible and collectively unreadable. Three concrete
 * failures, all fixed by deleting structure rather than relabelling it:
 *
 *   1. *The row teleported.* Saving a key moved that provider out of the grid
 *      into a "Connected" block ABOVE it, growing a section that was not there
 *      a second earlier. Order is now fixed; a saved row gains a check and
 *      stays put.
 *   2. *The same provider appeared twice* — once as a connected summary with a
 *      "Replace key" button, once as an empty field. Now one row, and typing
 *      in it IS replacing.
 *   3. *"Show 181 more providers" was a wall,* not an invitation. The search
 *      field carries the count in its placeholder and needs no disclosure to
 *      hold it. Nobody browses 181 providers; they search for the one they
 *      have an account with.
 *
 * Custom providers moved out entirely, to their own tab
 * (`custom-provider-panel.tsx`) — a job almost nobody does should not be the
 * last thing on the screen everybody uses.
 *
 * **Anthropic's subscription half has no control — deliberate, disclosed.**
 * `PROVIDER_NOTES.anthropic` reads "Claude Pro/Max subscription or your own API
 * key", but there is no Anthropic OAuth anywhere in this repo: the only live
 * provider OAuth is `startProjectProviderOAuth(projectId, 'openai', ...)`
 * (`chatgpt-subscription-connect.tsx:58`). The note renders verbatim because
 * JAY-510 requires it; the missing flow is a product gap, not something this
 * file may invent. OpenAI's subscription half IS real and mounts as
 * `subscriptionSlots.openai`.
 *
 * **Layers.** `ProviderConnectView` is pure (props only, no hooks) so it renders
 * under `renderToStaticMarkup` with no `QueryClientProvider` — the repo's only
 * render-assertion idiom. `ProviderConnect` is the container and owns every
 * hook. Same split as `sandbox-tab.tsx` / `models-tab.tsx`.

 * ## No Connect button
 *
 * The button is gone because the row can tell when you are done with it: the
 * save fires when focus LEAVES the row (`onBlur` + a `relatedTarget` containment
 * check), which is one save per provider no matter how many fields it has, and

/**
 * Presentational only — no hooks, no fetching. Kept separate from
 * `ProviderConnect` so it renders under `renderToStaticMarkup`; every slot
 * defaults to `undefined` so the bare view needs no provider tree.
 *
 * ## One list. No sections.
 *
 * A search field, one line of instruction, and rows. That is the entire
 * screen.
 *
 * It had four sections — Connected, Add a key, a "Show 181 more providers"
 * disclosure, and Custom provider — and each one was individually defensible
 * and collectively unreadable. Three specific failures, all fixed by deleting
 * structure rather than by relabelling it:
 *
 *  1. **The row teleported.** Saving a key moved that provider out of the
 *     grid and into a "Connected" block ABOVE it, growing a section that was
 *     not there a second earlier. Finishing a field should never move it.
 *     Order is now fixed and a saved row just gains a check.
 *  2. **The same provider appeared twice.** Once as a connected summary with
 *     a "Replace key" button, once as a field. Now: one row, and typing in it
 *     IS replacing.
 *  3. **"Show 181 more providers" was a wall.** The number was not an
 *     invitation, it was a warning. The search field replaces it — it says
 *     the count in its placeholder and needs no disclosure to hold it, and
 *     nobody browses 181 providers anyway. They search for the one they have
 *     an account with.
