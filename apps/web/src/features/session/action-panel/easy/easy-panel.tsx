/**
 * `EasyPanel` — the non-technical home for a session's right panel: three
 * promise cards (Progress / Outputs / Context) over the same tool-call data
 * `AdvancedPanel` renders one-at-a-time. Same props shape as `AdvancedPanel`
 * (plus the session's busy flag) so `session-layout.tsx` can swap between them
 * freely.
 *
 * Easy mode is chrome-free: no tab strip, no header, no border. The panel IS
 * the three cards. They expand in place and never navigate away from each
 * other — the only thing that ever replaces them is a detail (a step's tool
 * views, a Context group, a file, a running app), and the panel owns that,
 * because a card cannot replace its own parent.
 *
 * Must use `collectAllToolParts`, not `collectToolParts`: the latter strips
 * `read`/`skill` parts, which is correct for Advanced's one-at-a-time
 * stepper but would silently empty out Easy mode's "Read N files" narration
 * and the Context card's "Files read" bucket.

   * parallel way to open the same detail that could drift from it later. The

   * mistaken for one if it ever leaked into a siblings list.
