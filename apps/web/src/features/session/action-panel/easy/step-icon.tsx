/**
 * `StepIcon` — the glyph at the head of a Progress row.
 *
 * A row used to lead with an anonymous status dot, which told you a step had
 * *happened* but never what KIND of thing it was. The icon says the kind at a
 * glance (and matches how the Context card leads its rows), while colour still
 * carries the state: muted when done, red when it failed, and the running step
 * keeps its live pulse — the one case where "is it moving?" matters more than
 * "what is it?".
