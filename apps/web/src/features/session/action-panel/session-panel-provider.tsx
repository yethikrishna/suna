/**
 * `SessionPanelProvider` — the single owner of everything a session's panel
 * surfaces show, hoisted above BOTH of them.
 *
 * The two surfaces live on opposite sides of the screen and in different React
 * subtrees: the Outputs/Context/Preview cards float over the chat (inside
 * `SessionChat`, in the main resizable panel), and every detail — terminal,
 * browser, files, file preview — renders in the right-hand detail panel. A row
 * clicked in the cards has to open a detail on the other side of that divide,
 * so the state cannot live in either one. It lives here, mounted at
 * `SessionLayout`, wrapping both.
 *
 * This is a MOVE, not a rewrite. Everything below came out of `easy-panel.tsx`
 * — which owned the cards and the detail together, back when they were the same
 * panel — with its comments intact. Two behaviors are load-bearing and easy to
 * "clean up" by mistake:
 *
 *  1. Every consume-effect subscribes to a store VALUE, never to the (stable)
 *     consume action. Both surfaces stay mounted while their panel is closed,
 *     so a request that only flipped a stable reference would never re-render
 *     anyone and the handoff would silently dead-end.
 *  2. The terminal is not a `detail`. It is a keep-alive layer with its own
 *     open flag, because `DetailLayer` tears a detail's body down on close and
 *     that would drop a live PTY WebSocket. See `PersistentLayer`.
