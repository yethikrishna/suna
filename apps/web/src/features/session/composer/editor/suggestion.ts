/**
 * The render-callback shape both the `@` mention menu and the `/` slash menu
 * implement. This is the one `@tiptap/suggestion` code path both triggers go
 * through — `createMentionSuggestion` (`../menus/mention-controller.ts`) and
 * `createSlashSuggestion` (`../menus/slash-controller.ts`) each build a
 * `MenuController` and hand it to `baseSuggestion` below.
 *
 * `onKeyDown` only receives `{view, event, range}` — NOT the full
 * `SuggestionProps` (verified against the installed
 * `@tiptap/suggestion@3.27.1`'s `plugin/props.ts`: the plugin's own
 * `handleKeyDown` calls `renderer.onKeyDown({view, event, range})`, nothing
 * richer). A controller therefore has to remember its own latest
 * `SuggestionProps` (for `.command`, to actually run a selection from the
 * keyboard) and its own latest flat row list (for what Enter/Tab should
 * select, and for how far ↑/↓ may wrap) in plain closure state across calls —
 * this is what keeps the selection index a DERIVED value instead of React
 * state, per Task 6's `moveSelection`/`clampSelection` design: there is no
 * React component above a controller for state to live in until the popup
 * actually mounts, and even then the popup is fed `selectedIndex` as a prop,
 * never owns it.
 *
 * Escape is not handled here on purpose: `@tiptap/suggestion`'s own
 * `handleKeyDown` intercepts `Escape`/`Esc` before calling into a renderer at
 * all, and unconditionally dispatches an exit transaction afterward (see
 * `createSuggestionProps` in the installed package) — every keyboard-driven
 * dismiss already reaches `onExit` without a controller doing anything.

/**
 * `allowedPrefixes: [' ', '\n']` reproduces the old rule — a trigger only
 * fires at the start of input or after whitespace, so `user@example.com` is
 * not a mention — without the backwards character walk at
 * session-chat-input.tsx:1011-1032.
 *
 * `startOfLine: false` is the fix for `/` being stuck at position 0. The old
 * regex was `/^\/(\S*)$/`, which made a slash command after a newline
 * impossible.
 *
 * `minQueryLength: Infinity` — neither menu uses the plugin's own
 * `items()`/`loading` machinery at all (both `items: () => []` above and
 * `command`/`onUpdate` computing rows themselves), but the plugin runs it
 * regardless of what `items()` returns: with the default `minQueryLength: 0`,
 * `exceedsMinQueryLength` is always true, so every keystroke transition takes
 * the async-fetch branch and dispatches the renderer TWICE (`loading: true`,
 * then `loading: false` once the — trivially resolved — promise settles),
 * on top of the ONE dispatch `onStart` already gets for free. Verified line
 * by line against the installed `@tiptap/suggestion@3.27.1`'s
 * `dist/index.js` (compiled from `src/plugin/view.ts`):
 * `dispatchStateUpdate("started", ...)` at line 588, the `if (!willFetch)`
 * branch point at line 591, a duplicate `dispatchStateUpdate("updated", ...)`
 * at line 597 (fired unconditionally before the fetch even starts), and a
 * FINAL `dispatchStateUpdate("updated", ...)` at line 624 once the fetch
 * settles — three renders for the opening keystroke, two for every keystroke
 * after. `state.query.length >= Infinity` is never true, so
 * `exceedsMinQueryLength` is always false, which takes the cheap synchronous
 * branch (lines 592-593) and skips both extra dispatches — exactly one
 * render per keystroke, matching how many times the query actually changed.
 * `minQueryLength` is consumed only by `createSuggestionView`
 * (`view.ts:124-127`) — it never reaches `createSuggestionState` (which owns
 * `char`/`allowedPrefixes`/`startOfLine`/`findSuggestionMatch`, i.e. the
 * trigger-matching this task exists to fix) or `createSuggestionProps`
 * (which owns `handleKeyDown`/decorations), so this is scoped purely to the
 * redundant fetch/render cycle and touches neither.
