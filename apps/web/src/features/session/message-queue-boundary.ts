/**
 * When it is safe to release a queued message.
 *
 * This module exists because the previous answer was wrong in three separate
 * ways, and all three were invisible from the code that used them:
 *
 *   1. **A finished tool call counted as a boundary.** Any tool part reaching
 *      `completed` or `error` drained the whole queue. A turn that runs Bash →
 *      Read → Edit hit three "boundaries" while the agent was still working, so
 *      a message typed mid-turn landed mid-turn. That is the reported bug.
 *   2. **`isBusy` was read as "the turn ended".** It is a 300 ms fade timer for
 *      the busy indicator (`session-chat.tsx`), so any gap between agentic
 *      steps longer than the fade looked like completion. A UI timer is not a
 *      transaction boundary, which is why `QueueDrainGates` does not have an
 *      `isBusy` field for anyone to reach for.
 *   3. **Loading older history fired it.** The drain watched the `messages`
 *      array, so tool parts prepended by scrolling up counted as new
 *      completions. Nothing here reads `messages`.
 *
 * The replacement is a small state machine over signals that actually mean
 * something: the server's own session status, plus the gates that mean the run
 * is paused waiting for a human. It is pure and clock-injected, so every rule
 * below is asserted in a unit test rather than observed by hand.
