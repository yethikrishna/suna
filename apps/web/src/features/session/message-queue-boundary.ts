/**
 * When it is safe to release the queue.
 *
 * The agent finishes the task it is on, and then **everything waiting goes out
 * together**, on one prompt, in the order it was typed. Nothing overtakes;
 * nothing is held back for a later turn.
 *
 * This module answers only *when* — how much is released is `claimBatch`'s in
 * `@kortix/sdk/message-queue`, and what the single prompt contains is
 * `queued-batch.ts`. Keeping those separate is why the batching change did not
 * have to touch a single gate below.
 *
 * The previous answer to *when* was wrong in three
 * separate ways, all of them invisible from the code that used them:
 *
 *   1. **A finished tool call counted as a boundary.** Any tool part reaching
 *      `completed` or `error` drained the whole queue. A turn that runs Bash →
 *      Read → Edit hit three "boundaries" while the agent was still working, so
 *      a message typed mid-turn landed mid-turn. That is the reported bug.
 *   2. **`isBusy` was read as "the turn ended".** It is a 300 ms fade timer for
 *      the busy indicator (`session-chat.tsx`), so any gap between agentic
 *      steps longer than the fade looked like completion. A UI timer is not a
 *      transaction boundary, which is why `QueueDrainGates` does not have an
 *      `isBusy` field for anyone to reach for.
 *   3. **Loading older history fired it.** The drain watched the `messages`
 *      array, so tool parts prepended by scrolling up counted as new
 *      completions. Nothing here reads `messages`.
 *
 * The replacement is a small state machine over signals that actually mean
 * something: the server's own session status, plus the gates that mean the run
 * is paused waiting for a human. It is pure and clock-injected, so every rule
 * below is asserted in a unit test rather than observed by hand.

 * a sandbox that dies mid-turn and boots fresh leaves the last assistant
 * message permanently open — `time.completed` never set, no error ever patched
 * (no `session.error`, no `server.instance.disposed`: the process that owned
 * the turn is simply gone). That husk lives in the server's own transcript, so
 * it survives a hard refresh, and the queue wedged forever behind it.
 *
 * A live turn produces evidence: the status poll reports busy within one
 * liveness interval (10s), which resets this clock via the `isServerBusy`

 * *observed by this tab*. The intent was right — the next message must wait for
 * the turn this one starts — but the mechanism was a second, weaker copy of

 *
 * `isServerBusy` reads `useSyncStore.sessionStatus[sessionId]`. `handleSend`
 * calls `beginOptimisticSend`, which writes `{ type: 'busy' }` into that exact
 * slot **synchronously, before any await** — and `useSessionSync` additionally
 * forces busy while a prompt is observed in flight. So by the time the drain
 * ticks again after a dispatch, the busy gate is already closed. The head is
 * genuinely alone on the wire; the latch was asserting a fact the gate had
 * already established.
 *
 * What the latch uniquely did was fail closed. If that busy period never
 * arrived — a send that errored before reaching the server, a missed status
 * event, a tab that was asleep — every later message waited forever on a turn
 * that never started. That is the "the queue just stops sending" report, and it
