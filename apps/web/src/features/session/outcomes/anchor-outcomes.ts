/**
 * Which turn does an outcome belong to?
 *
 * The rule: the turn whose [startedAt, endedAt] span contains the outcome's
 * timestamp. Nothing is ever DROPPED — an outcome before the first turn anchors
 * to the first, and one after the last anchors to the last. That last case is
 * the common one, not an edge case: a change request is written moments after
 * the turn's final message, so a strict containment test would orphan almost
 * every card.
