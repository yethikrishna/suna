/**
 * The session's outcomes, computed ONCE.
 *
 * Not a per-turn hook, deliberately. `session-chat.tsx` carries an explicit
 * warning that its turn component re-renders ~60×/second while a response
 * streams, and that ~28 `useMemo`s hang off each render. A `useChangeRequests`
 * call inside the turn would multiply one network cache read by every turn in
 * the transcript, on every frame.
 *
 * So: one query here, one anchor pass here, and `useTurnOutcomes` returns a
 * slice by key. The slice identity is stable while the outcome set is
 * unchanged, so a turn that has no outcomes re-renders no differently than it
 * does today.
 *
 * ## Why this hook and not the SDK's
 *
 * Two hooks named `useChangeRequests` exist, and they populate DIFFERENT React
 * Query caches:
 *
 * - `@kortix/sdk/react` keys on `['project-change-requests', projectId, status]`
 * - `@/features/project-files/hooks/use-change-requests` keys on
 *   `['project-files', 'change-requests', projectId, 'list', status]`
 *
 * `ChangeRequestDetailDialog` — the modal this card opens — mutates through the
 * project-files hook, and its `useInvalidateAll` (use-change-requests.ts:237)
 * invalidates `changeRequestKeys.project(projectId)` and nothing under
 * `project-change-requests`. Read the SDK cache here and a card would still
 * say "Waiting for you" after the user merged the change request in the dialog
 * two inches above it.
 *
 * That is exactly the failure this whole feature exists to prevent — "the
 * status is a lie the moment it is written" is the first line of the spec's
 * problem statement. So the provider reads the cache the mutations invalidate.
 *
 * The consequence: this provider must sit inside a `ProjectFilesProvider`,
 * because the hook takes its project id from that context rather than a
 * parameter. Task 5 mounts it.
