/**
 * What the transcript's queued bubbles (`turn/queued-prompt-bubbles.tsx`)
 * render, from the ONE thing that holds a pending message.
 *
 * The server inbox (`GET .../prompts`) is the queue: durable, shared across
 * tabs and devices, ordered and admitted by the control plane. Every prompt
 * goes there.
 *
 * This function used to merge that list with a second, browser-local one, and
 * every row carried its ORIGIN so each action could address the store that
 * actually held it. The browser store is gone — with it the localStorage blob a
 * closed tab lost, the drain that guessed at turn boundaries from a debounced
 * `isBusy`, and the two-lane ordering problem that needed a `serverPromptPending`
 * gate to stop both lanes firing at the same boundary. What is left is a
 * projection of one list, which is why there is no `source` and no `localIds`.
