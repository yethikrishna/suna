/**
 * Reasoning-effort control for the session chat composer — shown only for a
 * model that actually exposes a tunable effort knob, driven off the SAME
 * live models.dev capability data (`@kortix/llm-catalog`'s
 * `generationControlCapabilities`) that gates the gateway settings'
 * Generation Controls panel (`generation-controls.tsx`, #4995). Never a
 * hardcoded per-model list — a reasoning model with no `reasoning_options`
 * entry still gets the generic low/medium/high fallback, a model that isn't
 * `reasoning: true` at all gets nothing.
 *
 * *** WHY THIS WRITES A PROJECT-LEVEL SETTING, NOT A PER-MESSAGE ONE ***
 * OpenCode's own message-send payload (`SendMessageOptions` in
 * `@kortix/sdk`'s `use-opencode-sessions/keys.ts`, consumed by
 * `promptRuntimeMessage`) only ever carries `model` / `agent` / `variant` /
 * `directory` — there is no per-message reasoning-effort field to set on a
 * chat send today. Separately, models.dev-sourced models don't populate
 * OpenCode's legacy per-model `variant` map, so a model like
 * `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` has no per-model variant to cycle even though it's
 * very much a reasoning model.
 *
 * The one path that reliably reaches the wire today is the per-project
 * **model_generation_config** the gateway injects at resolution time —
 * `packages/llm-gateway/src/pipeline/generation-defaults.ts` merges it into
 * the outbound OpenAI-shaped body (`reasoning_effort`) for any field the
 * client didn't already set, and `apps/api/src/llm-gateway/routing/
 * resolve-route.ts` re-clamps + supplies it per request from
 * `project_llm_routing_policies.model_generation_config` (same table/API the
 * Gateway → Routing settings page's "Generation defaults" panel writes).
 * This component reads/writes that same config, scoped to
 * (this project, this exact wire model) — every session in the project
 * sending to this model picks up the change immediately, and an explicit
 * per-request value (should OpenCode ever grow one) would still win, since
 * injection only ever fills a field the client left unset.
 *
 * Writing requires the `gateway.routing-policy` PUT's capability gate
 * (`PROJECT_CUSTOMIZE_WRITE`, editor+) — a plain project member gets no
 * control at all. A locked dropdown that cannot change the value is noise.
