/**
 * The five `/start` shapes a `stopped`/`failed`-classified session can arrive
 * as, bound to the two real page.tsx call sites and to the order they are
 * checked in (`wakeLadderHolding` -> `recoverableFailure` -> ... -> `fatal`).
 *
 * Rows 2 and 3 populate `session.failure` and are decided by
 * `recoverableFailure` (page.tsx ~684), which reads the real `retriable`.
 * Rows 1, 4 and 5 never populate `failure` and are decided by `fatal`
 * (page.tsx ~552, `shouldPaintFatalCard`), which reads `stage` ONLY -- neither
 * `retriable` (row 4, park, proves it cannot be trusted) nor `activelyStarting`
 * (row 3's second `stoppedWakeResult` call site can report `actively_starting:
 * true` on a genuinely `failed` stage, and a terminal stage must still paint).
 *
 * Row 2 is decided by BOTH in sequence: `recoverableFailure`'s `session.failure`
 * branch withholds it first (retriable:true); once the wake ladder is also
 * exhausted, `recoverableFailure` still returns null (no OTHER branch of it
 * matches -- `sandbox.status` is `'stopped'` not `'error'`, and the sandbox
 * row is non-null) so control falls through to `fatal`, which withholds it
 * again on `stage:'starting'` alone -- the actual reported bug, and pinning
 * ONLY the `recoverableFailure` verdict for row 2 (as round 1 did) missed it.
