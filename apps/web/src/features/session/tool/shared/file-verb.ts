/**
 * What a call DID to a file, in the tense the row is actually in.
 *
 * Every other surface in this feature already speaks this way. `step-label.ts`
 * turns a part into `Wrote` / `Writing`, `activity-file-chips.tsx` labels a run
 * of writes `Wrote 3 files`, `narration.ts` narrates the panel, and
 * `patch-summary.ts` derives a patch's verb from what the patch contains. The
 * `BasicTool` trigger was the one surface left speaking machine: `write`
 * rendered the literal registry key `Write`, and `edit` rendered `Editing`
 * forever — present participle on a transcript from last week, which is the
 * whole reason a settled row read as a paused one.
 *
 * So the trigger joins the others rather than growing a sixth copy of the
 * grammar: this module is the table, and `patch-summary.ts` reads it too.
 *
 * Three tenses, because a row has three things it can honestly say:
 *
 *   running — the call is in flight and the input is still arriving
 *   done    — the call settled and did what the verb says
 *   failed  — the call settled and did NOT do what the verb says
 *
 * `failed` is not decoration. `group-steps.ts` already forbids a failed step
 * from wearing success wording ("Wrote budget.csv" for a write that errored is
 * the panel lying, W7) and routes it through `narrateFailedStep`. The trigger
 * had no such route: it flipped its icon to a warning and kept claiming the
 * write landed. The wording here is `narration.ts:805` character for character
 * — `write` for a write, `update` for an edit — so the row and the panel say
 * the same thing about the same failure.
 *
 * No React import: this is a pure lookup, and it is unit-tested as one.

/**
 * What was done, not which tool did it.
 *
 * Keyed by action rather than by tool name because the two consumers key
 * differently: the trigger rows come in as `write` / `edit` / `morph_edit`,
 * while `patch-summary.ts` comes in as an `add` / `update` / `delete` / `move`
 * patch op. Both map onto the same short list of English verbs, and mapping onto
 * a shared vocabulary is the point — it is what stops `apply_patch` from
 * inventing a second word for something `write` already has a word for.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO `create`. Producing a file that was not there is a
 * WRITE, and the reader has already met that word on every `write` row in the
 * session; a patch that adds four files saying `Created 4 files` beside a
 * `write` row saying `Wrote app.py` is one product speaking two vocabularies
 * about one act. `narration.ts` reached this conclusion already — it reports a
 * write-family patch as `Wrote`, never as `Created`. `patch-summary.ts` maps
 * its `add` op onto `write` for the same reason. `delete` and `rename` keep
 * their own verbs because no write-family word covers them.
