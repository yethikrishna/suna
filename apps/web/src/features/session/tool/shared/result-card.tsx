 * The card a tool's result list lives in — web sources, matched files, grep
 * hits, patched files.
 *
 * A run of rows should read as one object the tool returned, not as loose rows
 * leaking into the step list around it. Every one of these tools previously
 * rendered a bare `max-h-72 overflow-auto` div, so the rows had no edge and ran
 * straight into the chain rail beside them.
 *
 * Elevation is the hairline alone: the tool-view grammar forbids shadows
 * (asserted in conformance.test.ts). `--popover` already lifts off
 * `--background` in dark mode; in light both are pure white, so the border does
 * the work on its own.
