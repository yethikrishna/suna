/**
 * The way into the sub-agent's own session, pinned to the right edge of the row.
 *
 * It used to be a ghost `Button` at the BOTTOM of the disclosure body, and that
 * was wrong twice over. It sat at the body's left margin — the chain's icon
 * gutter — so it read as one more step in the sub-agent's list rather than as
 * an action on the agent. And it was reachable only by expanding the row, which
 * is backwards for a sub-agent that has not produced a step yet: that is the
 * one moment the full view is the ONLY thing there is to look at.
 *
 * A `span role="button"`, not a `<button>`. This node renders inside the
 * disclosure's trigger, and `DisclosureTrigger` clones that trigger into its own
 * `role="button"` element — a button nested in a button is invalid HTML. The
 * subtitle link in `InlineTriggerTitle` is the same shape for the same reason.
 * Both activation paths `stopPropagation` so reaching the full view does not
 * also toggle the row underneath it.
 *
 * Visible label "Full view", accessible name "Open full view". The row already
 * carries a title plus a live subtitle that has to truncate, so the right edge
 * gets the two words that matter; the longer name rides on `aria-label` and
 * `title`, and it CONTAINS the visible text, so WCAG 2.5.3 (Label in Name)
 * holds.
 *
 * Always visible, never hover-revealed: a hover-only affordance does not exist
 * on touch, and this is the only route to a running sub-agent's full transcript.

/**
 * A task call is a disclosure row: what the sub-agent is doing, in place.
 *
 * This row used to be a plain button that opened `SubSessionModal` on any
 * click. That put the only view of a running sub-agent behind a modal — the
 * reader had to leave the transcript to learn what the agent they just
 * dispatched was up to, and had to close it again to get back — while the
 * `SubAgentActivity` list this component already assembled was unreachable dead
 * code on that path. The steps are the answer to the question the row raises,
 * so they belong under the row, and the modal is now an explicit action on the
 * row rather than the row's whole behaviour.
 *
 * The trigger is unchanged: while the sub-agent runs its subtitle is that
 * agent's LAST step, so a collapsed row still reports live progress.
 *
 * The body is the sub-agent's steps and NOTHING else, so it is passed only when
 * there are steps. A disclosure whose body is empty is a caret that promises a
 * body and opens onto nothing — the same verdict `ActivityBurst` reaches for a
 * burst that merges to zero rows. Before the full view moved to the trigger,
 * that button was the sole occupant of the body of a just-started sub-agent,
 * which is what kept the empty case from being empty.
