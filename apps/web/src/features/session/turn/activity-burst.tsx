/**
 * One burst — a maximal run of non-text parts.
 *
 * Renders as a chain of thought: a muted summary line that expands into a
 * connected vertical chain of steps. The chain has two levels — a run of
 * consecutive same-family calls is ONE step that opens to its members, so the
 * expansion groups the work the same way the collapsed summary line does.
 *
 * The trailing burst stays open for the whole working turn (so SSE gaps between
 * tool calls do not blink it shut); earlier bursts auto-collapse once later
 * text/standalone closes them. Manual after the user's first click. Collapsed
 * height is always one row. A settled chain closes on a "Done" step so the rail
 * terminates instead of trailing off.

/**
 * A run of consecutive same-family calls: one summary row that opens to its
 * members.
 *
 * This is the level the collapsed burst title has always described. The title
 * says "Read 2 files, ran 2 commands" and, until this row existed, expanding it
 * produced four flat siblings — the summary grouped and the expansion did not.
 *
 * The group binds to `ChainOfThoughtStep`'s OWN `Disclosure`, so it opens
 * independently of every other step and the chain rail still spans it however
 * tall it grows. Trigger and content must be one component rather than two
 * sibling children of the step: `Disclosure` renders exactly
 * `React.Children.toArray(children)[0]` and `[1]`, and the step's rail already
 * claims slot 0 — passing them as siblings would silently drop the content.
 *
 * `pl-7` puts the members under the group's LABEL (size-4 icon + gap-3), clear
 * of the rail at `left-2` — the indent is what says these rows belong to the
 * row above rather than to the chain.
 *
 * The group row is the PARENT of the rows it opens, and says so without colour:
 * `font-medium` against the regular-weight tool titles underneath it (see
 * `InlineTriggerTitle` in tool/shared/infrastructure.tsx). Indent alone left the
 * two levels reading as one list at a glance.
 *
 * `step.status` is consumed here, not discarded. `groupSteps` already picks the
 * WORDS — a group holding a failure gets `narrateFailedStep`, never success
 * wording — but the row used to render the same muted glyph either way, so the
 * only failure signal inside an open burst was the sentence, and a reader had to
 * click one level deeper to find out anything had gone wrong.
 *
 * Failure REPLACES the family glyph rather than sitting beside it, the same call
 * `ToolOutcomeIcon` makes one level down: the row has one 16px gutter, and what
 * the reader needs from it is the verdict — the family is still spelled out in
 * the words immediately to its right ("Couldn't read your files"). Shape carries
 * it as much as colour, so the mark survives a reader who cannot see the red.
 *
 * Running shimmers the label, which is how every tool row in this same chain
 * already says "still going" — one running vocabulary per surface, not two.
