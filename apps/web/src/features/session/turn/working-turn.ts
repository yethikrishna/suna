/**
 * WHICH turn is the one the agent is working on.
 *
 * It used to be "the last one", by definition — and that was true until a
 * prompt could be queued mid-turn. Now the transcript can end with one or
 * more user messages the agent has not reached yet: OpenCode persists a
 * queued prompt as a user message the moment the server forwards it, and
 * the agent picks it up between steps, minutes later. During that window
 * the LAST turn is a bubble with nothing under it, and the turn that is
 * actually streaming (with its "Thinking" burst, its tool calls) sits one
 * or more turns UP. Pinning the working indicator to the last turn painted
 * "Figuring out what's next…" under a message nobody had started, and left
 * the live turn looking settled.
 *
 * The rule, in order:
 *
 *  1. The working projection names a turn. This is the server's current turn
 *     or this tab's fresh send receipt. It outranks incomplete transcript
 *     metadata because message completion can arrive one frame late.
 *  2. The newest turn that has any assistant content. If its newest
 *     assistant message is still open (no `time.completed`), that is the
 *     working turn — the agent is visibly writing there. Older turns with an
 *     open assistant message are husks (a box that died mid-turn); the
 *     newest turn with content outranks them.
 *  3. Otherwise the NEWEST pending turn. OpenCode parents the next step to
 *     the latest user message and answers every queued message before it in
 *     that same step — so that is where the shimmer lands, and the ones
 *     before it are already taken (bright, no indicator of their own).
 *  4. No pending turns: the newest turn with content (its step just ended;
 *     the next one has not opened yet — the indicator stays put instead of
 *     flickering).
 *
 * `null` for an empty transcript — and for a transcript with no assistant
 * content at all whose every prompt the server is still holding: there is no
 * turn the agent is on, only pending ones.

  //
  // Picking the newest pending turn is right when the transcript is all we
  // have — OpenCode parents its next step to the latest user message. It is
  // WRONG for a prompt the control plane is still holding: `GET .../prompts`
  // lists it `queued` / `waiting (older_prompt_pending)` / `delivering`, which
  // is the server saying, in as many words, that it has not run yet.
  //
  // MEASURED, local stack 2026-08-26 (session 65216cc6): two sends 700ms
  // apart, the first not yet streaming. `GET .../prompts` reported the second
  // `queued`, then `waiting: older_prompt_pending`, then `delivering` — while
  // the transcript rendered it at full opacity with no "Queued" label, because
  // it had been made the WORKING turn here. The working projection's hint is
  // null in that window (the inbox, not the ledger, is what decides `working`
  // right after a send — `projectWorking`), so nothing else could correct it.
  //
  // Skipping the held ones only moves the shimmer; it never hides a turn. When
  // every pending turn is held, the working indicator falls back to the newest
  // turn with content (rule 4) and all of them read as queued — which is
  // exactly the state the server is describing.

  // and threw `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'userMessage')`,
