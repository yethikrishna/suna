/**
 * Drives the queue: watches the gates, waits for a real end-of-turn, and sends
 * exactly one message when it arrives.
 *
 * First come, first served. `queue[0]` goes out alone; everything behind it
 * waits for the turn that message starts to finish, then the new head goes.
 * That ordering IS the feature — merging the queue into one prompt would hand
 * the agent several unrelated instructions at once and lose the sequence the
 * user typed them in.
 *
 * What was broken was never the one-at-a-time rule. It was that the queue kept
 * stopping: a latch that waited for a busy period the tab might never observe,
 * and a gate that stayed closed forever after the stop button. Both are gone.
 * See `message-queue-boundary.ts`.
 *
 * All of the judgment lives in `message-queue-boundary.ts` as pure functions,
 * and the claim/complete/fail bookkeeping lives in the store. What is left here
 * is the part that genuinely needs React and a clock: re-evaluating when a gate
 * changes, and setting one timer for the settle window.
 *
 * Two things this hook deliberately does NOT do, both of them root causes of
 * the bug it replaces:
 *
 *   - It never reads `messages`. The old drain watched the message array for
 *     tool parts flipping to `completed`, which fired mid-turn on every tool
 *     call and again whenever scrolling up loaded older history.
 *   - It never reads `isBusy`. That is a 300 ms fade timer for the busy
 *     indicator; `QueueDrainGates` does not expose it.
 *
 * The dispatch lock is the store's `claimNext`, not a ref here. Two mounted
 * views of one session share the store, so the claim is genuinely exclusive —
 * a ref would only be exclusive per component.
