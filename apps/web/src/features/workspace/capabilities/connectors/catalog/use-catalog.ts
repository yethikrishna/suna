/**
 * The catalogue behind the Discovery and All tabs, from whichever of the two
 * sources this project actually has.
 *
 * **Why two sources.** `connectors_api_discover` resolves to `false` by
 * default (`apps/api/src/experimental/features.ts:83`), so the Discover
 * catalogue is unavailable to most projects. Easy Connect (Pipedream) is not
 * flagged. Falling back keeps the page populated for every project.
 *
 * **Why not merge them.** The two publish overlapping apps under different
 * slugs and different `id` namespaces, and each has its own add flow. A merged
 * list would need a cross-catalogue identity that neither API provides.
 *
 * **One paging mechanism.** A scroll or a click on "Load more" fetches the next
 * page. That is all. This replaces a three-layer arrangement — eager initial
 * pages, a per-category auto-deepening effect chain, and a client-side reveal
 * window over the top — that existed only because the client had to accumulate
 * enough pages to fake a category filter. The server filters by category now
 * (`pipedreamCatalogPage`), so the client asks for exactly the page it renders.
 *
 * **Filtering happens server-side, over the whole catalogue.** Both `q` and
 * `category` are query keys, so changing either starts a new list rather than
 * re-slicing an accumulated one. Pipedream's own API cannot filter by category
 * at all — see `apps/api/src/connectors/pipedream-index.ts`.
