 * reach the agent, rather than what the agent can reach). Last is where a
 * reader stops expecting the strip to keep filtering one thing.
 *
 * Discovery and All are dropped entirely on a deployment with no catalogue —

 * `connectors_api_discover` that catalogue is Pipedream's, which answers `501`
 * on every request unless three env vars are set. They are removed rather

 * Connected is the project's own connectors. There is no Needs-attention tab —
 * see `connector-filter.ts` for why it became a sort key instead — and no

 * own top-level Customize tab until it folded in here. The two REST namespaces
 * stay separate (`…/channels/*` vs `…/connectors/*`) and no data model was
 * merged; what merged is the question a person is answering, which in both
 * cases is "wire this project to something outside it". It replaces the body
 * rather than filtering it, and takes the connector search box and the
 * custom-connector Add button off the header while it is up.
 *
 * `?scope=` is the tab, so every scope is linkable — which is what lets the
 * retired `/projects/<id>/channels` route redirect to a real destination
 * instead of a page that lands on Discovery and hides what was asked for.

 * **What Add opens.** Only the custom-connector form (OpenAPI / Postman /
 * GraphQL / MCP / HTTP). Everything the Add-connector modal used to hide
 * behind a four-tab strip now lives on the page: Easy Connect and Discover as
 * catalogue cards, Channels as catalogue entries alongside them. A modal is
 * the right home for a form; it was the wrong home for a catalogue.
 *
 * `?c=<slug>` still owns which connector's detail is open, and that is
 * load-bearing rather than cosmetic. `SetCredentialModal` starts an OAuth 2.0
 * authorization-code grant by sending the browser to the provider with
 * `success_redirect_uri = window.location.href` minus the two `oauth2*`
 * params. The user comes back through a full page load, so any React state
 * saying "this connector's modal was open" is gone — but `?c=` survives,

                Text, not a chip. This row already carries the tab strip's
                filled control; a second bordered pill opposite it would read as
                a second selector rather than a way out to a settings surface.
                `variant="text"` is the codebase's muted-text affordance
                (`text-muted-foreground` → `text-primary` on hover); `px-0` drops
                the pill padding so the label sits flush with the container's
                right edge, mirroring the tab strip flush left. It keeps the
                full `h-8` of `size="sm"` as its hit area.

                `ml-auto` rather than leaning on the shell's `justify-between`:
                when the row wraps on a narrow viewport this lands alone on the
                second line, and `justify-between` would drop it to the LEFT
                there. `ml-auto` holds it right in both layouts.

                Not gated on `canWrite` — anyone who can open the page can read
                the project's approval policy. */}
