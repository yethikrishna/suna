 * `PoliciesPanel`, `DiscoverCatalogue` and `ConnectorConnectionModal`. An ES
 * module is all-or-nothing to the bundler, so two `import` lines put that
 * entire graph in front of a page that paints a grid of cards.
 * `connector-identity.tsx` was lifted out of that file for exactly this
 * reason; these were the two edges that put it straight back.
 *
 *   • `ConnectorModal` reaches it via `connector-accounts.tsx`
 *     (`ConnectionRoster`/`ConnectionSection`/…) and its own
 *     `SetCredentialModal`, and owns the only `usePipedreamConnect` call on
 *     the route.
 *   • `CustomConnectorForm` is the `+` modal's body.
 *
 * Neither can render before a click, so neither needs to be parsed before
 * one. `ssr: false` keeps them out of the server bundle too — a closed modal
 * has no markup worth streaming.
