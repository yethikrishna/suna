/**
 * A content signature for a set of pattern rules, immune to the one reordering
 * the write path performs.
 *
 * Two callers depend on this in `connector-tools.tsx`: the reseed guard, which
 * refuses to rebuild the draft while the server's pattern set is unchanged, and
 * the dirty check behind Discard/Save.
 *
 * `orderPolicyRules` is applied FIRST, and that is the whole point. The
 * optimistic cache write puts `orderPolicyRules(write.rules)` into
 * `['connector-policies', …]` on every per-tool click, which hoists every
 * non-pattern rule ahead of every pattern rule. A signature that encoded raw
 * array position therefore changed when nothing about the rules did:
 *
 *   server order   [{delete_*}, {retired_tool}]   -> "delete_*=…\nretired_tool=…"
 *   after a click  [{retired_tool}, {delete_*}]   -> "retired_tool=…\ndelete_*=…"
 *
 * The reseed guard read that as "the server's pattern set changed", rebuilt the
 * draft, and threw away whatever the user had half-typed into a new row. Since
 * `orderPolicyRules` is exactly the transformation being defended against,
 * normalizing through it is immune by construction — and, unlike a plain sort,
 * it still reports a genuine reorder WITHIN either class, which the engine
 * resolves by authoring order and which the user can still cause by deleting a
 * row and re-adding it.
