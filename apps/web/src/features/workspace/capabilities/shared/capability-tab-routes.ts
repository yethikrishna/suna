/**
 * The capability pages that graduated out of the Customize overlay. Commands
 * was removed (its standalone page deleted) and lives only in the Customize
 * overlay again — `/customize/commands` via the `proj-commands` palette entry.
 * Order is the tab order; it is also the order the sidebar lists them in.
 *
 * Triggers graduated out of the Settings overlay, where it was two rail tabs
 * (Schedules, Webhooks) rendering one component
 * (`components/projects/schedule-view.tsx`) filtered by trigger type. It is
 * ONE tab here, not two: both are the same backend resource — a project
 * trigger — that starts an agent either on a schedule or on an incoming
 * request, and a person deciding "how should this start?" should not have to
 * pick a tab before they even know the answer. The type picker lives inside
 * the create flow instead (`schedule/schedule-create-modal.tsx`).
 *
 * Channels went the OTHER way: it was a tab here and is now a scope of the
 * Connectors page (`channelsHref` below). Unlike Schedules/Webhooks the two are
 * NOT one backend resource — `/projects/{id}/channels/*` is inbound reach
 * (Slack, Teams, email installations and their per-channel bindings),
 * `/projects/{id}/connectors/*` is outbound tool access — and nothing merged
 * them. What merged is the navigation: both answer "wire this project to
 * something outside it", and splitting that question across two top-level tabs
 * made the answer depend on knowing which direction the bytes travel.
 *
 * No `icon` field, on purpose. This module is pure data and is imported by
 * SERVER components (`/projects/[id]/channels/page.tsx` needs `channelsHref`);
 * a `@phosphor-icons/react` import here calls `createContext` at module load
 * and fails `next build` ("Failed to collect page data" — Deploy Dev
 * 2026-08-19). The tab bar is text-only anyway (Marko, 2026-08-19: eight mixed
 * 16px glyphs in one row read as clutter); the sidebar Customize row and the
 * index cards keep their own icons in their own client files.

/**
 * This array is the tab order, the sidebar order, and — via the first entry
 * the caller may read — the landing tab. `TAB_PREFERENCE` in
 * `project-sidebar/project-settings-nav.tsx` mirrors it and is asserted
 * against it, so reordering here moves the landing tab too.
 *
 * ## Agents lead, everything else is their library
 *
 * Customize is agent-centric (Marko, 2026-09-01). An agent is the only
 * object a project manager grants a person or a group access to — the object
 * policy for `agent` is `closed`, every other resource is `open`
 * (`apps/api/src/iam/authorize.ts`) — so it is the primitive every other
 * decision hangs off: which model it thinks with, which skills it loads,
 * which connectors and secrets it may reach, when a trigger starts it. The
 * bar is ordered the way that decision is made: Agents leads, alone, and the
 * resources an agent draws on — Skills first among them — follow behind a
 * seam. `PRIMARY_TABS` below names the leading group so the bar can draw it.
 *
 * Every tab lives under `/projects/<id>/customize/<segment>` (Marko,
 * 2026-09-03); `CAPABILITY_SEGMENT` maps a key to its segment. The Agents key
 * stays singular for stability, its segment is `agents`, and one agent lives
 * one level deeper, at `agentHref` (`/projects/<id>/customize/agents/<name>`).
 *
 * There is no Settings tab. `/projects/<id>/config` — the bar's trailing
 * "Settings" tab, a sub-nav over General / Sandbox templates / Review /
 * Feature flags / Upgrades — was retired on 2026-09-02 (Jay). Its
 * configuration sections live in the Settings overlay's Workspace group
 * (`settings/rail.ts`, opened with Cmd+, or from the workspace switcher), and
 * Review — an inbox, not configuration — moved up onto this bar as its own
 * tab. `settings-tabs.ts` redirects every retired `/config?section=` link.
 *
 * Review is the one flag-gated tab (`review_center`); `visibleCapabilityTabs`
 * in `capability-tabs.tsx` hides it while the flag is off.
