 *     the member floor role in #6522 (`apps/api/src/iam/role-perms.ts`), so a
 *     plain project member gets NO tabs here. They had none of the entry
 *     points either, but a direct URL still renders this layout, and a bar of
 *     seven tabs that every one of them 403s on is exactly the "shown but not
 *     openable" surface this gate exists to remove.
 *  2. Each tab's own read leaf — a custom role can hold the surface and still
 *     have one capability deactivated.
 *
 * Optimistic while a probe is in flight: a tab disappears only on a denial we
 * actually received, so a slow `/effective` never blanks the bar for a
 * manager mid-navigation.

 * "Members" — the tab-shaped row-item that launches the account-level Access

 * sensitive to "every capability tab is a real page at /projects/<id>/<key>",
 * and this row is not one — clicking it navigates away entirely. So it's a
 * plain styled `Link` rendered as a `TabsList` sibling, matching a
 * `TabsTrigger`'s exact classes for visual parity, but living outside the
 * `Tabs`/`TabsTrigger` roving-tabindex/active-state machinery: it never lights
 * up as "current" (you're never actually on it), and Radix never needs to
 * reason about it as a tab panel.
 *
 * Needs the project's account_id, which this bar doesn't otherwise fetch —
 * `qk.project.detail(projectId)` is the same query key the page shell above
 * already populates, so this is a cache hit, not a second request.
 *
 * Gated on `project.members.read`, NOT `project.members.manage`: the hub's
 * project panel renders read-only for anyone who can read the member list and
 * probes `members.manage` itself for every write control it offers
 * (`components/iam/access-projects-tab.tsx`). Gating this launcher on manage
 * would hide a page a member can legitimately open.
