 * This exists because the slot was once deleted from the component while three
 * call sites still passed `leading`, and **nothing caught it at runtime**:
 * React silently ignores a prop a component does not declare, so every
 * connector logo and command glyph simply stopped rendering with no error, no
 * warning, and no failing test. `tsc` did report it — as
 * `Property 'leading' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes &
 * CatalogCardProps'` — but that string is easy to wave off as the repo's known
 * React 19-vs-18 `IntrinsicAttributes` noise, and it was.
 *
 * So the contract is asserted here instead, where it cannot be mistaken for a
 * types-version artefact.
