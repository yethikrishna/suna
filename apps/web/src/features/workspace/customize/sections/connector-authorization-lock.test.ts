/**
 * The authorization owner is settled once a connector exists.
 *
 * Switching it afterwards silently changes WHOSE account every future session
 * runs as, and orphans the connections and permission rules already
 * stored under the old owner — a change shaped like a toggle that behaves like a
 * migration.
 *
 * Locked in the UI ONLY: the mutation and its route are deliberately left in
 * place so re-enabling is deleting one prop. These assertions exist so that
 * "leave the backend for later" does not quietly become "the backend rotted".
