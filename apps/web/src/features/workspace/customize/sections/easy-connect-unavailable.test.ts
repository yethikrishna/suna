 * An app with no actions is listed, and stopped at the point of action.
 *
 * The catalogue used to withhold every Pipedream app with `has_actions: false`
 * — 1,263 of 3,230, 39.1%. That made them unreachable by any query at all,
 * including their own exact name: `q=Auth0` returned zero results because the
 * one Auth0 record is action-less, and `q=SAP` returned 21 of the 30 apps
 * Pipedream itself lists, with both real SAP records missing. Listing them is
 * the fix; saying so at the add step is what stops the fix becoming a dead end.
