/**
 * Models — the whole `/projects/[id]/models` page: the shared capability
 * shell, one tab strip, and whichever section that strip has selected.
 *
 * ## It is the same page as Connectors, Agents and Skills, or it is wrong
 *
 * This screen used to build a SECOND shell inside the first one: a full-height
 * `Tabs` root, its own bordered tab row with its own horizontal padding, an
 * `underline` tab list, and six `TabsContent` panels that each opened their own
 * `overflow-y-auto`. Sat inside `CapabilityPageShell`, that read as a different
 * product from the five sibling tabs on the Customize bar — a rule under the
 * active label where every sibling draws a filled pill, content indented 20px
 * further than the heading above it, and up to three nested scrollers.
 *
 * There is one shell now. The tab strip is the shell's `filters` slot and uses
 * the DEFAULT `Tabs`/`TabsList`/`TabsTrigger` — no `type`, no `size`, no
 * classes — which is character-for-character what `connectors-page.tsx` passes.
 * The project-default model picker is the shell's `action` slot, beside the
 * heading, where every sibling page puts its one page-level control. The active
 * section is plain local state and renders as the shell's `children`, so the
 * shell's scroll container is the page's only one.
 *
 * ## Seven tabs
 *
 * Order follows the work: bring a key in, choose models, add your own provider,
 * hand a key out, shape the routing, then watch what it costs and what it did.
 *
 *  - **Providers** (was "API keys") is now ONLY the provider list. The gateway
 *    key and its reference moved out — see `gateway-access-tab.tsx` for why the
 *    split is by direction.
 *  - **Gateway** is that key plus the endpoints for calling it. Both legacy
 *    deep-links that used to land on `providers` (`llm-keys`, `llm-api`) land
 *    here, because this is where their content is.
 *  - **Playground is gone.** A prompt box that fanned one message across
 *    models. Every project already has a real session for that, one click away,
 *    with the full runtime behind it. Deleted, not hidden. The API route it
 *    called (`POST /gateway/playground`) still exists and is untouched.
 *  - **Budgets folded into Costs.** The cap belongs under the number it caps —
 *    see `gateway-budgets.tsx`.
 *
 * The active tab is LOCAL state, so switching tabs never touches the main
 * Customize rail. Deep-links / `openCustomize('llm-providers')` set the hosting
 * panel's section, read here via `useSettingsNav()` (once, and followed on
 * change) to pick the initial tab.
 *
 * This view reads `useSettingsNav()`, never a store directly, so it mounts
 * under either the legacy Customize panel or the new Settings panel — see
 * `features/workspace/shared/settings-nav-context.tsx`.
