/**
 * `ProjectProviderModal` — the `Modal` SHELL around `provider-connect.tsx`.
 * It owns no connect UI of its own any more: JAY-510 collapsed the old
 * "Add provider" and "Connected" tabs into `ProviderConnect`'s four sections
 * (Connected / Add a provider / More providers / Custom provider), and deleted
 * the always-on search bar that used to sit above the tab row — the search now
 * lives inside the More-providers disclosure where it belongs.
 *
 * Two tabs remain, because they are two different questions:
 *   - **Providers** — `ProviderConnect`: which providers this project can call.
 *   - **Models**    — `ModelsTab`: which of the connected providers' models the
 *                     picker offers. Kept as its own tab rather than nested one
 *                     level deeper, which is where it used to live.
 *
 * Two live mounts, both dialogs: the model selector's connect dialog
 * (`use-model-connection-gate.tsx:138`) and the Secrets tab's "Manage
 * providers" button (`secrets-view.tsx:353`). The Models settings tab mounts
 * `ProviderConnect` DIRECTLY (`gateway-view.tsx`) — connecting a provider there
 * opens no dialog at all, which is JAY-510's first acceptance criterion.

          with every tab switch (3 key rows vs 34 model rows vs the Custom
          form). `lg:min-h` + `lg:max-h` clamp that `h-auto` to a constant.

/**

 * CONTROLLED, but with no effect and no re-seeding: `useState`'s initializer
 * runs once per mount, and the parent's `key={`${open}-${defaultTab}`}`
 * remounts this on every open — so reopening still lands on the requested tab,
 * exactly as the uncontrolled version did, with no `setState` in an effect
 * body (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`).
 *
 * Controlled at all because the Custom tab has to be able to hand the reader
 * back: saving a custom provider gives it a key like any other, and the API
 * keys list is where it now has a row. A "Done" that leaves you on the form
 * you just submitted is not done.
