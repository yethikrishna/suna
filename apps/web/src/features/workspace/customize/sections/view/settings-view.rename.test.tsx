/**
 * `SettingsView`'s `GeneralProjectCard` cannot be rendered or driven here:
 * `apps/web`'s `bun test` runs WITHOUT `--isolate`, so mocking
 * `@tanstack/react-query` process-wide would corrupt every other file in the
 * run, and there is no jsdom/`@testing-library/react` harness here either.
 *
 * So the coverage is split in two, and neither half alone proves the fix:
 * this file pins that `GeneralProjectCard`'s rename `mutation` wires
 * `onMutate`/`onError`/`onSettled` to the shared `renameOnMutate`/
 * `renameOnError`/`renameOnSettled` functions — the gap a
 * helpers-in-isolation test cannot see, because a silent revert to a local
 * no-op still passes it — while `project-rename-cache.test.ts` proves what
 * those functions DO, including the Critical rollback path, against a real
 * QueryClient.
 *
 * This card is now the ONLY rename path. `EditProjectModal` was the other
 * one and had its own paired source-scan file; the workspace-switcher work
 * deleted that modal, so both went with it.
