/**
 * useConfigureThread — start an agent-led "configure" session from Customize.
 *
 * Project config (agents, skills, commands, …) lives in the repo and is
 * read-only from the UI — the only way to change it is through a session that
 * edits the files on a branch and opens a change request. So "Create new" and
 * "Edit" here don't write files directly: they spin up a fresh session seeded
 * with a prompt, close the Customize overlay, and drop you into the thread
 * (the session auto-sends the stashed prompt once its runtime is ready, same
 * as the project-home composer). The agent then asks what you want and opens a
 * CR you can review + merge.
