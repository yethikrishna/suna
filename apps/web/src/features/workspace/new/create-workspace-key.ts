/**
 * A stable `idempotency_key` for one create attempt on `/new`.
 *
 * `POST /v1/projects/provision` mints a brand-new managed repo per call, so a
 * reload, a second tab, or a retry after a lost response used to create a real
 * duplicate workspace with its own upstream repo. The key is what stops that.
 *
 * Per the API contract in `apps/api/src/projects/routes/r1.ts`, the key
 * identifies the ATTEMPT, not the payload — the same key with a different name
 * returns the FIRST project and silently ignores the new payload. So the
 * fingerprint passed in by the caller must include everything that makes a
 * create *distinct*, and the key must be reused only across retries of the
 * same create.
 *
 * The TTL matches `PROVISION_ATTEMPT_TTL_MS` in `lib/onboarding/ensure-first-project.ts`
 * and is chosen against the slowest provision this repo documents — a snapshot
 * build of up to ~9 min. At 6x that ceiling the bound can never expire a key
 * while the attempt it identifies could still be committing.

 *
 * Before Task 14 wired `retry` into a clickable control
 * (`new-workspace-page.tsx`), the only way to re-run a create was
 * resubmitting the whole form, so minting a fresh key on every
 * storage-unavailable call was low-frequency — at most one extra key per
 * manual resubmit. With a retry BUTTON, a user in a storage-blocked browser
 * can click it repeatedly, and a fresh key per click mints a fresh upstream
 * managed repo per click — the exact failure idempotency exists to prevent.
 * This map keeps the minted key stable across calls with the SAME
 * fingerprint for the lifetime of the page load even with nothing
 * persistable. Cross-reload dedupe is still lost without storage, unchanged
 * from before — only the "click retry twice in one session" case is fixed.
