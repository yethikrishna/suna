 * would be a choice that can only fail: the user fills in a name, presses

 *
 * Same predicate as `create-account-selection.ts`'s `options` filter, so the

 * stripping it here used to hand `AccountPicker` a value indistinguishable
 * from `user.email`, which it then painted straight into the identity slot.
 * An invited admin whose one creatable account is the owner's personal

/**
 * A creatable-accounts list the viewer's identity cannot be anchored to: two
 * or more accounts, none of them the viewer's own (`account_id === userId`).
 *
 * Deliberately excludes a SOLE foreign account. `GET /v1/accounts` only ever
 * returns accounts this specific signed-in user is a genuine member of
 * (`accountMembers.userId = userId`, `apps/api/src/accounts/core/accounts.ts`),
 * and `filterCreatableAccounts` further narrows that to owner/admin roles —
 * so a SOLE creatable account that is not the viewer's own is the ordinary
 * invited-admin shape: someone added as admin on an account before ever
 * having their own personal account bootstrapped (`bootstrapPersonalAccount`
 * only fires when the caller has ZERO existing memberships,
 * `apps/api/src/accounts/core/accounts.ts`). That is legitimate and common,
 * not a leak — it is exactly the scenario Task 1's fix protects (Task 2
 * controller addendum A2.2), so it is never FOREIGN on its own.
 *
 * The N=1 case this function CANNOT catch, and no longer has to: a SOLE
 * foreign account (the branch above that returns `false`) used to be
 * INDISTINGUISHABLE, from this function's inputs alone, from a stale account
 * list still holding a DIFFERENT, previously-signed-in user's single-account
 * list. Both shapes are exactly one account, `account_id !== userId`, so
 * rejecting one would have permanently locked legitimate invited admins out
 * of creating any workspace. That gap is closed one layer up instead,
 * structurally: the account list is cached under `qk.accounts.list(userId)`
 * (`packages/sdk/src/react/query-keys.ts`), read only through
 * `useAccountsList()` (`hooks/account/use-accounts-list.ts`), and every
 * reader is gated `enabled: !!user`. A previous user's list — of ANY size,
 * not only one account — is not ADDRESSABLE from this user's session, so it
 * cannot reach this function at all any more.
 *
 * WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE 2+-ACCOUNT CASE THIS FUNCTION ACTUALLY GUARDS:
 * before the key scoping above, a 2+-account list with no anchor to the
 * viewer had TWO possible causes — (a) a stale or wrong cache entry left by a
 * DIFFERENT signed-in user, or (b) a genuine, still-rare shape: a user who
 * owns/admins 2+ team accounts and has no personal account of their own, so
 * none of their creatable accounts is `account_id === userId`. The key
 * scoping above closes (a) the same way it closes the N=1 case — a previous
 * user's list cannot reach this function at all. It does NOT close (b): that
 * user's OWN list, correctly scoped to their OWN session, still has zero
 * anchor to their identity, because their identity genuinely has no
 * creatable account of its own. So today the ONLY reachable trigger for this
 * predicate is (b), a legitimate user, not a caching defect — reachable via
 * SAML JIT provisioning (`iam/sso-sync.ts` inserting a membership directly)
 * or direct invite acceptance (`accounts/invites.ts`), either of which can
 * add someone as owner/admin on 2+ accounts without ever running the
 * `memberships.length === 0` personal-account bootstrap gate.
 *
 * This check still earns its place and must NOT be deleted or relaxed: (b)
 * is real, and this function still cannot tell "a genuine multi-account user
 * with no personal account" apart from any other reason a response might
 * carry zero anchor to the viewer — guessing which of 2+ unrelated accounts
 * is safe to default into is worse than refusing to guess (G2, fail-closed).
 * What changed is the caller's obligation: since the reachable trigger is now
 * a LEGITIMATE user rather than a caching artifact, `new-workspace-page.tsx`
 * must render that user a REASON, not a silently disabled form — see its own
 * comment where `foreignAccountList` is read.
 *
 * `userId` is required, not optional: an omitted argument used to compile
 * clean and silently degrade to `undefined`, which made every 2+-account
 * list FOREIGN by accident (a functional break for real multi-account users,
 * not a security hole, but one no single-account test could catch). The type
 * also does not accept `undefined` at all — only `string | null` — so a
 * caller that cannot yet establish identity must say so explicitly with
 * `null` rather than by omission. `null` already fails closed correctly: no
 * real `account_id` is ever `null`, so `!some(...)` is `true` for any 2+
 * list, exactly the G2 fail-closed direction this function exists for.
