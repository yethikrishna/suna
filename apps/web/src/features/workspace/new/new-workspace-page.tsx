 * Create a workspace.
 *
 * This page issues no MUTATING request on mount. Visiting `/new` never
 * creates anything — the only write it ever fires is the one the submit
 * button drives, routed through `useCreateWorkspace` (`use-create-workspace.ts`),
 * which POSTs `/projects/provision` with a stable `idempotency_key`. A page
 * that creates something because you looked at it is a page nobody can link
 * to safely.
 *
 * It DOES read the account list on mount (`useAccountsList()`) — an
 * idempotent GET, needed to know whether there is anything to disambiguate
 * (`AccountPicker`) and to gate submission on the REAL account count instead
 * of a placeholder. That hook is the exact
 * cache entry `WorkspaceSwitcher` and `AccountSwitcher` already use, so a user
 * who reaches `/new` from either menu (the common path) hits a warm cache,
 * not a second request. That list is filtered to `creatableAccounts` (owner
 * or admin — `POST /provision` 403s on anything else, same predicate as
 * `create-account-selection.ts`) before it reaches either the picker or the
 * submit gate, so a user can never pick, or implicitly submit into, an
 * account that would fail.
 *
 * Layout: one centered column. The icon leads at `size-12` on its own line —
 * it is the only thing here you can express something with, and inline beside
 * the input it read as an adornment on the field rather than a choice. Then the
 * name, then the account, then Advanced, which stays hidden until the workspace
 * has a name: it is a second decision about a thing that does not exist yet.
 *
 * No bordered card. A single question does not need a surface to group it — the
 * border drew a box around one field on an otherwise empty page, which reads as
 * chrome rather than structure. The primary button is still a sibling below the
 * field group at full width, so the fields read as "the thing you fill in" and
 * the button as "the thing you press".
 *
 * There is no slug or URL field. `POST /provision` derives the repo slug as
 * `${baseSlug}-${projectId}` precisely so two workspaces can share a name —
 * there is no uniqueness constraint to validate against and no availability
 * check to run. This component holds no validation rules of its own; both the
 * charset/length check and the submit gate come from the shared form model.
 *
 * `/new` is also where `/projects` sends an account with zero workspaces
 * (Task 8), so a user must never be trapped here — the create-into account
 * picker (or email fallback) sits top-left and a `Log out` control sits
 * top-right, independent of the form below.

                      takes exactly its own width and the field takes the rest,
                      with no flex-basis guessing. `items-end` bottom-aligns the
                      tile with the input rather than the label above it.

                      The icon is held back until the workspace has a name, for
                      the same reason Advanced is: it is a decision about a thing
                      that does not exist yet, and an empty page led by a smiley
                      asks you to decorate before it asks you to name. Once
                      named the tile is never blank — it shows the initial the
                      workspace would carry anyway, through `EntityAvatar`, the
                      same chalk tile the switcher rows and project cards draw.
                      So the default is a real default you can see and keep.

                      No `gap` while the column can still be closed: a gap is
                      there whether the icon is or not, so it would hold a hole
                      open before the first keystroke and make the reveal start
                      from a ledge. The spacing lives INSIDE the collapsing box
                      as an animated `paddingRight`. Once an icon is PICKED the
                      column is open for good and the tile is tinted, so the
                      extra `gap-1.5` is safe and keeps the fill off the input. */}
