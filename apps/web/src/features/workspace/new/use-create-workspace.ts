 *
 * 502 and 503 are NOT the same failure and must not share a message. This

 * (`ensure-first-project.ts:254`) — managed git is not configured on this

 * out of quota. The server's own message is reused verbatim rather than
 * inventing new copy — it already states the exact limit and the upgrade
 * path, matching what the deleted create modal's `isProjectLimitError`
 * handling reused for the same code (`ensure-first-project.ts`).
 *
 * `provision_in_flight` (409, final-review FIX 1) also gets its own branch,
 * never the raw server text: `PROVISION_IN_FLIGHT_CODE`'s own doc comment
 * (`packages/sdk/src/core/http/api-client.ts`) names the literal string

/**
 * Whether a failed create should offer a retry.
 *
 * Classified by whether ANYTHING could plausibly be different on the next
 * attempt — NOT by "everything except 503". `retry` (below) resends
 * `lastState` completely unedited, through the SAME `runCreate` path with
 * the SAME persisted `idempotency_key`, so a failure whose cause cannot
 * change between now and a later click must not offer one; doing so would
 * spend the user's next click on a request guaranteed to fail identically.
 * Fix round 1 finding: the first version of this function offered a retry
 * for a 400 too, which fails this exact test — see the `status === 400`
 * branch below.
 *
 * - `400` (bad name / invalid payload) — NOT retryable. `retry` resends the
 *   exact payload that just failed validation; a deterministic validation
 *   failure on an unchanged payload fails identically every time. Only
 *   editing the name, through the primary submit button, can help.
 * - `403` (wrong account / insufficient role) — retryable. Role and account
 *   membership are external state that CAN genuinely change between the
 *   failure and a later click, and `retry` re-closes over `creatableAccounts`
 *   (`useCreateWorkspace`'s own `['accounts']` query), which is refetched —
 *   so a role grant made in the meantime can turn this into a success.
 * - `502` (bad gateway) — retryable. A transient upstream/gateway fault; a
 *   later attempt can land differently with no change on the client at all.
 * - `503` (this route's only 503 is `isManagedGitUnavailableError`,
 *   `ensure-first-project.ts:254`) — NOT retryable. A server configuration
 *   state; see `messageFor` above. Reuses that detector rather than
 *   re-deriving the 503 check, so this and `messageFor` can never disagree
 *   about which failure is which.
 * - `409` (`provision_in_flight`, final-review FIX 1) — retryable. Named
 *   explicitly rather than left to the default bucket: whether ANOTHER
 *   attempt with this key is still running is external state by
 *   definition, and it usually resolves within `runProvisionAttempt`'s own
 *   in-band backoff before ever reaching here (see that function's doc
 *   comment) — this branch only fires once that backoff is exhausted, and
 *   the underlying condition can still clear before the user's next click.
 * - Anything else (a plain network `Error`, an unrecognized status) —
 *   retryable. There is no signal here that rules out transience, so the
 *   safer default is to offer the retry rather than silently block a case
 *   that might actually succeed.
 *
 * Adding a new status code this route can return? Decide which bucket above
 * it belongs to — "the payload/state is deterministic and unchanged" (block
 * it) vs. "something could genuinely be different next time" (allow it) —
 * and add its own named branch rather than folding it into the default.

 * One provisioning attempt, preferring the live-progress

 *
 * The gate is **whether `onEvent` fired at all**, not the shape of the error
 * that follows. If the stream delivered even ONE event — a phase, or even
 * the terminal `error` event itself — it reached the server and did real
 * work, so ANY failure after that is a genuine provisioning failure and MUST
 * rethrow. Retrying it as a fresh `runCreateAttempt` call would be a SECOND
 * create for the same user intent — the exact "two upstream repos" failure
 * this function exists to prevent. Only when NOTHING was ever received AND
 * the failure is transport-shaped (`isTransportFailure`) is it safe to
 * conclude the stream never reached the server, and the fallback runs.
 *
 * The fallback reuses `payload` UNCHANGED — same `idempotency_key` the
 * streaming attempt just sent. It is the SAME logical attempt continuing on
 * a different transport, not a new one; a re-minted key here would be
 * exactly the bug this function exists to prevent, just moved one layer up.
 * Routing the fallback through `runCreateAttempt` (rather than a bare
 * `client.provisionProject` call) also means it inherits that function's own
 * 409 `provision_in_flight` retry, so the plain-POST path keeps its full
 * existing resilience even when reached through the stream.
 *
 * `onPhase(null)` fires once, right before the fallback runs — there is no
 * real phase information once the plain POST takes over, and freezing the UI
 * on the last streamed phase would show progress that stopped being true.
 *
 * **DECISION (final-review FIX 1, consequence 3): a 409 `provision_in_flight`
 * error ALSO reaches the fallback, regardless of `eventsReceived`.**
 * `emit('validating')` is the first statement of `runProvision`
 * (`apps/api/src/projects/provision-core.ts`), so by the time this failure
 * can arrive at all, `eventsReceived > 0` is already guaranteed — under the
 * plain "any event blocks fallback" rule, that made `runCreateAttempt`'s own
 * 409 backoff loop unreachable from the streaming path, the exact "409
 * backoff is dead on the primary path" finding from the final review. This
 * is deliberately narrower than the transport-failure gate above it, not a
 * loosening of it: a `provision_in_flight` failure is not "a genuine
 * provisioning failure that must never be retried as a second create" the
 * way a 502/503/plain error is. By construction it means another call
 * carrying this SAME `idempotency_key` is already mid-provision, so handing
 * it to `runCreateAttempt` (identical key, unchanged payload) is exactly
 * correct: either the server returns the SAME project once the in-flight
 * attempt commits, or it 409s again and the loop keeps waiting — never a
 * second upstream repo, and never a second create for this user intent.

/**
 * Drives the `/new` submit button: mints/reuses the idempotency key, POSTs
 * the create (with retry-on-in-flight via `runCreateAttempt`), primes the
 * workspace caches, and enters the guided onboarding for the new project on
 * success. All of that sequencing lives in `runCreate`, above — this hook
 * only wires it to the live `queryClient`/`router`/`user` and to component
 * state.
 *
 * Fetches `['accounts']` itself — the same cache entry `new-workspace-page.tsx`,
 * `WorkspaceSwitcher` and `AccountSwitcher` already read — rather than taking
 * `creatableAccounts` as a parameter, so this hook can resolve the create's
 * target account (`resolveTargetAccountId`) without a second, page-specific
 * query.
