 * Who is allowed to draw a "bring the sidebar back" control.
 *
 * The project sidebar is `collapsible="offcanvas"` — collapsed means gone, not
 * an icon rail — so every view that can be looked at with it hidden needs a way
 * back. Five of them grew their own copy of that control, each with its own
 * visibility rule, and the rules drifted apart:
 *
 *   - the session header gated on the desktop shell,
 *   - project home, the sessions inventory, the capability tabs and the
 *     Customize sections did not.
 *
 * On the desktop shell that is two openers for one panel, and the page-level
 * copies are absolutely positioned at `top-2 left-2` — which on macOS is
 * directly on top of the traffic lights. One rule, in one place, instead.

 * The desktop shell, read once. The user agent cannot change mid-session, so

 *
 * Lazy `useState` (not a module constant) because `navigator` does not exist
 * during SSR. Every caller lives under `ProjectShell`, which renders a blank
 * placeholder until client auth resolves, so the first client render matches
 * the server's and this cannot desync hydration.

 *
 * - No sidebar context → no.
 * - Desktop shell → no. `ProjectSheelLayout` draws the single one, placed in
 *   the OS title-bar band clear of the window controls. A view-level copy
 *   would be a duplicate, and lands under the macOS traffic lights.
 * - Mobile → always. The panel is a Sheet with no docked affordance, and
 *   `state` there still reflects the DESKTOP cookie — so gating on it would
 *   strand the only way in whenever that cookie happened to say 'expanded'.
 * - Otherwise → only while the panel is undocked. Docked, the panel's own
 *   header carries collapse; two controls for one panel is one too many.
