/**
 * The sidebar variant of the project switcher is a merged control: the Kortix
 * mark and the project name in one shell, two hit areas.
 *
 * They shipped as two separate controls — a mark button beside a switcher —
 * which read as clutter because they answer the same question and looked
 * nothing alike. Merging them is only worth it if the merge holds: one shell
 * that reacts as a unit, and neither destination lost on the way in.
 *
 * Asserted against the source for the same reason as the header test:
 * observing this otherwise means mounting the sidebar with its auth, query,
 * i18n and sidebar providers to look at one row.
