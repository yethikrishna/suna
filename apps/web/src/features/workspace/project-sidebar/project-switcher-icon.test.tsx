/**
 * The project switcher's list rows show each project's own icon.
 *
 * Without it a user picks 🐢 in the create modal, sees it on the card in
 * /projects, opens the project, and the switcher beside the name shows "T" —
 * the feature visible on one of the two surfaces that render a project's
 * identity.
 *
 * SPLIT INTO TWO LINKS, because the component itself cannot be rendered here.
 * `ProjectSwitcher` needs a router, three react-query caches and two zustand
 * stores, and its list lives inside a `DropdownMenuContent` that renders
 * nothing while the menu is closed — which it always is on a first paint. The
 * alternative, `mock.module`-ing next/navigation and @kortix/sdk, is
 * process-wide in `bun test src` and would leak into the other 293 files.
 *
 *   1. the source scan below pins the exact props the row hands EntityAvatar;
 *   2. the render below pins what EntityAvatar does with those exact props.
 *
 * Neither half is worth much alone. Together they cover the whole path.
