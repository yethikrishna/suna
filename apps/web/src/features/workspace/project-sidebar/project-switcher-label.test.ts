/**
 * The warm-cache label, and the invariant that pays for it.
 *
 * Navigating /projects → /projects/<id> leaves the LIST warm and the DETAIL
 * cold, so a detail-only label showed a skeleton until `getProjectDetail`
 * landed — a name we already had on screen one route earlier.
 *
 * The original two-titles bug was list-FIRST (`activeProject?.name ??
 * detail`), which let the two caches disagree on screen. List-as-PLACEHOLDER
 * is not that: the list is consulted only while the detail has produced
 * nothing at all. The moment the detail entry exists it governs, including
 * when what it holds is blank — a blank name is the detail's answer, not an
 * invitation for another source to answer instead. That is what keeps the
 * single-source guarantee while restoring the warm paint.
