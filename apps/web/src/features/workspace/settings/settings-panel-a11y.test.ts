/**
 * Keyboard-activation invariant for the settings rail.
 *
 * Radix `Tabs` defaults to `activationMode="automatic"`, which SELECTS each tab
 * as arrow keys move over it. The rail has 28 entries and every pane fetches on
 * mount, so under the default, arrowing from Profile to the bottom of the rail
 * mounts every pane in between and fires each one's queries — a cost only
 * keyboard users pay. WAI-ARIA's guidance is manual activation whenever
 * selecting a tab has a side effect.
 *
 * This is asserted against the SOURCE rather than rendered markup on purpose:
 * `activationMode` is a React prop that Radix consumes internally and never
 * emits as a DOM attribute, so `renderToStaticMarkup` cannot see it. A prop
 * that silently reverts to a worse default is exactly the kind of regression
 * nothing else here would catch — the panel would still render, still pass
 * every markup test, and still typecheck.
 *
 * Same readFileSync approach as `components/iam/member-role-safety.test.ts`.
