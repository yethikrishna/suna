/**
 * Settings tab identifiers + helpers.
 *
 * This is the merged vocabulary for Kortix's three former settings surfaces —
 * the project Customize overlay, the user settings modal, and the account
 * settings page — now collapsed into one project-scoped settings overlay at
 * `/projects/[id]/settings(/<tab>)?`. It reads its active tab from the path
 * segment or, for legacy links, the old `?section=` / `?customize=` query
 * params. This module keeps the tab enum, the default, and a parser in one
 * spot so the overlay, the sidebar, and any deep-link helpers all agree on
 * the canonical list.
 *
 * Files, Changes, Agent(s), Connectors, and Skills are NOT settings tabs —
 * they are standalone `/projects/[id]/<section>` pages (any member can
 * browse Files; Agent/Connectors/Skills gate on their own read leaf — see
 * capabilities/capability-tab-routes.ts). Everything else that used to live
 * across the three old surfaces now lives here, in some cases under a new
 * id — see `legacySectionRedirect`. Deep-link routes still accept every
 * legacy section/tab name and redirect them where applicable.
