/**
 * The settings panel keeps ONE visual coordinate system: switching tabs must not
 * move the content column around.
 *
 * Before this test the 16 tabs used FOUR different widths — `max-w-lg`,
 * `max-w-2xl`, `max-w-4xl`, and a lone `max-w-6xl` on Usage. Going
 * Profile (32rem) -> Members (56rem) -> Usage (72rem) shifted the column by up
 * to 40rem. Every file was individually defensible; the set had no rule.
 *
 * Jay's call (2026-08-10): two tiers, one rule.
 *
 *   FORMS  `max-w-2xl` — single-column settings, the width the design system
 *          already prescribes (`.claude/skills/kortix-design-system/SKILL.md`,
 *          "Container: mx-auto w-full max-w-2xl").
 *   TABLES `max-w-4xl` — surfaces with a real table, which genuinely need the
 *          horizontal room.
 *
 * Jay's follow-up (2026-08-12): the rule was right, the classification was not.
 * Four tabs sat in the TABLE tier with no table anywhere in them — Sandbox,
 * Snapshots, Groups and Identity render card/row lists, so they were claiming
 * 896px of column they never used and pulling the eye sideways on every hop
 * from General. They now sit at `max-w-2xl` with the forms, and `max-w-2xl` is
 * the panel default — including for the Customize sections the panel mounts
 * (see the second describe block below).
 *
 * The check that decides the tier reads the tab's SUBTREE, not just its own
 * file. Half these tabs are a container plus a slot, and the table lives in the
 * slot child. Counts below are `TABLE_MARKUP` matches / `<TableHead>` columns,
 * re-measured 2026-08-12: Audit's table is in `components/iam/audit-tab.tsx`
 * (17 / 5 — Event, Scope, Principal, Result, Time), Roles' in
 * `components/iam/roles-tab.tsx` (15 / 5), Api-keys' in
 * `components/iam/api-keys-card.tsx` (17 / 6; rewritten 2026-08-12, the table
 * used to live in the deleted `service-accounts-card.tsx`), Usage's in
 * `features/billing/transactions-table.tsx` (17 / 6), which
 * `features/billing/credit-transactions.tsx` mounts — see `CHILD_SUBTREE`.
 * Grepping only `settings/tabs/*.tsx` finds a table in `members-tab.tsx` alone
 * (12 / 4) and reads those four as card lists, which is how a 5-column audit log
 * nearly lost 224px of column. `TAB_SUBTREE` below is that missing hop, and the
 * test asserts each mapped child is really mounted so the map cannot rot into a
 * rubber stamp.
 *
 * This test exists because the rule is otherwise unenforceable: a new tab that
 * picks its own width compiles, renders, and passes every other test. Adding a
 * tab means adding it to one of the two lists below — deliberately, not by
 * copying whichever neighbour you happened to open first.
 *
 * One tab delegates its container to a child view and so declares no width of
 * its own; it is listed as such rather than omitted, so a future reader can tell
 * "delegates" apart from "forgotten".
