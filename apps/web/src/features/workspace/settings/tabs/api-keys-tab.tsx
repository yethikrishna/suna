/**
 * The API keys tab — every key that lets something act on this workspace
 * without signing in, plus the rules the workspace puts on them.
 *
 * **What changed, and why (Jay, 2026-08-12).** This tab used to be two
 * imported cards stacked in a `max-w-4xl` column: a "CLI token lifecycle"
 * policy form and a "service accounts" table. Four things were wrong with it,
 * and each is fixed here:
 *
 * 1. *No way to create an API key.* The only key you could make from this tab
 *    was a service account. The CLI/API key flow lived in
 *    `features/accounts/settings/cli-tokens-tab.tsx`, which was mounted
 *    nowhere — deleted with this change, since both kinds now create from one
 *    dialog reached from the pane header (`components/iam/api-keys-card.tsx`).
 * 2. *An empty state nobody wanted.* "No service accounts yet" with an icon and
 *    a second create button, on a tab that already has one. With no keys the
 *    list now renders nothing at all.
 * 3. *The table was not aligned with anything.* Its cells were `align-top`, so
 *    the status badge and both dates floated above a two-line name cell, and
 *    the tab added its own `px-6 py-10` on top of the padding the pane already
 *    applies. It is still a table — Jay's call, and the right one for six
 *    columns of key metadata — with middle-aligned cells, in the `max-w-4xl`
 *    column the width rule gives a tab that renders a table.
 *
 *    *Which* table changed again on Jay's follow-up the same day: "use the same
 *    layout that is used in this secret tab." It had been the Members pane's
 *    borderless dialect — a hand-rolled `<table>` plus three local cell
 *    constants, because `@/components/ui/table`'s `Table` hard-codes its own
 *    bordered container with no escape hatch. It is now that shared `Table`,
 *    primitive for primitive with `secrets-view.tsx`: bordered `bg-popover`
 *    panel, `bg-accent` header, hover rows, `InputGroupSearch` above it, row
 *    actions in a `DotsThree` menu, and the status as a `Badge` with a glyph.
 *
 *    Above the table: one search field over the name, the key hint and the
 *    scope, and ONE filter where there were two — a four-pill status strip and
 *    a type dropdown became a single menu carrying both axes, one at a time
 *    (`ApiKeyFilterValue` in `api-key-rows.ts` argues why that costs nothing).
 *    "Expired" is derived rather than stored — `ApiKeyStatus`, same file.
 * 4. *It read as machine documentation.* "Personal Access Tokens", "the mint
 *    endpoint refuses PATs without an `expires_at`", "attach policies… as the
 *    principal". The copy is rewritten end to end — see
 *    `components/iam/key-rules-card.tsx` for the before/after table on the
 *    rules half.
 *
 * **Permissions — three leaves, not one.** The old tab gated everything on
 * `account.write`, which is admin-only, so a plain member could not so much as
 * see the keys their own workspace uses. The backend is more precise and this
 * now matches it exactly: `token.read` for the list (every member has it —
 * `iam/role-perms.ts`'s `MEMBER_BASELINE`), `token.create` for the create
 * action, `token.revoke` for the row actions (both in `ADMIN_EXTRAS`, and both
 * grantable to a member by explicit policy), and `account.write` for the rules
 * form (`PATCH /accounts/{id}/iam/pat-policy` asserts exactly that). One
 * batched probe, one roundtrip.
 *
 * **Two panes, one header.** The keys table is one tab; "Using a key" and the
 * key rules share the other, because neither is something you came here to
 * read — they are what you consult once, or set once. The pane title and the
 * Create key button stay above the tab bar so the create path is one click
 * from either. Underline tabs, the same primitive and the same arrangement as
 * the Members pane.
 *
 * **The split.** `ApiKeysTabView` is pure and props-only so it renders under
 * `renderToStaticMarkup` with no providers; `ApiKeysTab` is the container that
 * owns the hooks, including which tab is showing (Radix unmounts an inactive
 * `TabsContent`, so a controlled `section` prop is also the only way a test
 * can see the second pane). Same shape as `MembersTabView`. The keys table and
 * the rules form arrive as slots because both call `useQuery` internally.
