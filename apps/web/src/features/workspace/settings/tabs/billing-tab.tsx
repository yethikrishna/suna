/**
 * The Billing tab — plan/wallet/spend, per-seat claim/manage, auto top-up,
 * one-time credit top-up, and the Stripe billing portal. Ported from
 * `features/accounts/settings/billing-tab.tsx` (the `/accounts/[id]` page's
 * Billing pane) — see this task's report for the full numbered enumeration
 * of that file's controls/queries/mutations and where each landed here.
 * That source file is untouched: `/accounts/[id]` is still live and this task
 * must not modify anything under `app/(app)/accounts/**`.
 *
 * **Read vs. write gate — fix round 1.** The first version of this file
 * gated the WHOLE tab on `billing.write`, which is `OWNER_ONLY`
 * (`apps/api/src/iam/role-perms.ts`). The source page it was ported from
 * gated Billing visibility on `account.write` (`canWriteAccount` —
 * `app/(app)/accounts/[id]/page.tsx`), which admins hold too, and the
 * read-only plan/wallet/spend query (`GET /billing/account-state`) only ever
 * required plain membership server-side
 * (`apps/api/src/billing/routes/account-state.ts`) — no `billing.write` at
 * all. Gating the whole tab on `billing.write` therefore hid a view a
 * non-owner admin could always see before. Fixed by splitting the two:
 *
 * - **Whole-tab visibility** gates on `account.write` (`canViewBilling`
 *   below) AND `isBillingEnabled()` — matches the source page's
 *   `canWriteAccount` gate exactly. Admins and owners both see the tab;
 *   plain members see neither this tab nor the old page's Billing pane.
 * - **Mutating controls** — Subscribe to Team, the per-seat claim, auto
 *   top-up, buy credits, and the Stripe portal session — gate on
 *   `billing.write` (`canManageBilling` below), which the account-state
 *   response already carries as `can_manage_billing`
 *   (`apps/api/src/billing/routes/account-state.ts`'s `canManageBilling()` —
 *   the exact same server-side `billing.write` check
 *   `require-billing-write.ts` runs before any mutation, surfaced as a UI
 *   hint on the read query so the client never needs a second IAM
 *   round-trip). Read from `accountState?.can_manage_billing !== false`, the
 *   identical `!== false` (fail-open on `undefined`, matching the server's
 *   own "default true on probe error" comment) pattern
 *   `global-upgrade-modal.tsx` already uses for the same field. Since
 *   mutations are already rejected server-side without `billing.write`
 *   (`require-billing-write.ts`), hiding the controls client-side is a UX
 *   improvement (no button that 403s), not a new security boundary.
 *
 * **Account id.** The source file read `useBillingAccountId()` (the
 * `BillingAccountProvider` context `/accounts/[id]` wraps itself with, fed
 * by the route's own `account.account_id`) for the top-level query, the
 * (nonexistent) write probe, and `openUpgradeDialog`. This tab instead
 * resolves its account id with `useSettingsAccountId(accountId)` (see
 * `../use-settings-account-id.ts`) for those same uses — the project's
 * account wins when a project is open, falling back to the app-wide selected
 * account so the permission probe still resolves with no project open (the
 * same fix `connected-tab.tsx` needed — see that file's header comment).
 *
 * **`useBillingAccountId()` divergence — fix round 1, finding 2.**
 * `AutoTopupCard`, `CreditTopupSection`, and `useCreatePortalSession` each
 * read `useBillingAccountId()` internally rather than taking an explicit
 * accountId prop. That context's only other provider
 * (`project-shell.tsx`'s `BillingAccountProvider`, fed by
 * `projectDetail?.project?.account_id ?? null`, no store fallback) can
 * transiently disagree with `useSettingsAccountId`'s resolved value — e.g. a
 * multi-account user with a stale `selectedAccountId` opens a project before
 * `projectDetail` resolves: this tab's own query/permission read the store
 * fallback while those three widgets would read `undefined` (self-heals once
 * `projectDetail` resolves, but wrong in the meantime). Rather than adding an
 * explicit-accountId prop to three shared billing hooks (touches call sites
 * outside this tab, out of scope), `BillingTab` now nests its own
 * `BillingAccountProvider` — exported and side-effect-free to nest, per its
 * own header comment — around everything below it, seeded with THIS tab's
 * `resolvedAccountId`. React context resolves to the *nearest* provider, so
 * every `useBillingAccountId()` read inside this tab's subtree (the three
 * widgets above, plus `useCreatePortalSession`) now agrees with this tab's
 * own query/permission by construction; nothing outside this tab's subtree
 * is affected, since the outer `project-shell.tsx` provider is merely
 * shadowed, not replaced. See `BillingTab` (the outer component, which nests
 * the provider) vs. `BillingTabInner` (everything that must resolve
 * `useBillingAccountId()` to the SAME value as `resolvedAccountId`) below.
 *
 * **`isActive` dropped, not lost.** The source component took `returnUrl`
 * and `isActive` props and invalidated the account-state query on `isActive`
 * transitioning false→true, because it lived inside a surface that stayed
 * mounted (CSS-hidden) across tab switches. `SettingsTabPane` in
 * `settings-panel.tsx` unmounts every inactive tab's real view instead, so
 * this tab only ever mounts while it is the active tab — "on mount" already
 * means "on becoming active" here. `returnUrl` (an absolute URL, required by
 * the Stripe portal API) is now built from `window.location.href` instead of
 * threaded in as a prop, since the deep-link path itself no longer needs to
 * be known by a caller.
 *
 * `BillingTabView` is the pure, props-only half — no hooks, no data
 * fetching. `AccountOverviewTab`, `ClaimPerSeatCard`, `SeatManagementCard`,
 * `AutoTopupCard`, and `CreditTopupSection` all own their own React Query
 * reads/mutations internally, so they can't render under
 * `renderToStaticMarkup` (no `QueryClientProvider` there) — they're threaded
 * through as optional `ReactNode` slots instead, left `undefined` by default,
 * the same pattern `connected-tab.tsx` uses for `chatgptConnectSlot` (see
 * that file's header comment). `BillingTab`/`BillingTabInner` are the
 * container: every hook only runs once this tab actually mounts, which
 * `SettingsTabPane` guarantees happens only while this tab is the active one.
 *
 * **Untestable here, by design (see the task brief's constraints):** the
 * actual Stripe Checkout/portal redirects, the credit-purchase and
 * auto-top-up round trips, and the per-seat claim mutation all require a
 * live network + a real browser round trip. `bun test` has no DOM and no
 * live API — the tests in `billing-tab.test.tsx` cover everything the pure
 * view can prove statically: section order (Plan/wallet/spend before the
 * rest), the team-checkout branch replacing the main branch entirely, the
 * credits-ran-out banner, the `canPurchaseCredits`/`billingEnabled` gates,
 * the `canManageBilling` read/write split, and slot presence — they do not,
 * and cannot, click a button and observe a network call.
 *
 * **Linear card shape (2026-08-11) — presentation only.** Jay asked for this
 * pane to read like Linear's billing settings: a plan card, then labelled
 * sections whose content sits in one bordered box. Three changes, none of
 * which touch a query, a mutation, or a permission gate:
 *
 * 1. The team-checkout branch is now ONE bordered card — plan name and pitch
 *    on the left, the quiet `Manage billing` link next to the filled
 *    `Subscribe to Team` button on the right. Before, the name and pitch sat
 *    outside the card and the two buttons were stranded in a box beneath
 *    them, which read as two unrelated blocks.
 * 2. `Billing portal` is a `SettingsRow` inside a `SettingsRowGroup` (label
 *    and explanation left, control right) rather than a section header with
 *    the button in its action slot and the owner-only note loose below it.
 *    Linear closes its billing pane the same way — a section label, then the
 *    invoice surface in a bordered box. Kortix has no invoice list of its
 *    own; Stripe's portal IS that surface.
 * 3. Section rhythm tightened (`space-y-8` → `space-y-6`, `space-y-4` →
 *    `space-y-3`) to Linear's density.
 *
 * Everything the tab rendered before still renders, in the same order, under
 * the same gate: plan/wallet/spend, the per-seat claim, seat management, auto
 * top-up, buy credits, the portal, and the credits-ran-out banner.
