/**
 * The Groups tab — bulk-grant project access via account groups. Reuses
 * `components/iam/groups-tab.tsx`'s `GroupsTab` export UNMODIFIED, through a
 * slot (`RealGroupsTab` below) — see `groupsSlot` on `GroupsTabViewProps`.
 * That component is the account page's Groups pane
 * (`app/(app)/accounts/[id]/page.tsx:537-541`). It calls
 * `useQuery`/`useMutation`/`useRouter`/`useTranslations` internally, so it
 * can't render under `renderToStaticMarkup` — same reason
 * `billing-tab.tsx`/`usage-tab.tsx` thread their own hook-driven children
 * through slots instead of rendering them inline.
 *
 * **The gate — matches the source exactly, not inferred from the tab name.**
 * `app/(app)/accounts/[id]/page.tsx`:
 *
 * - `:356 groups: true` — the Groups tab/pane carries NO permission gate.
 *   Every member reaches it (unlike Roles — see `roles-tab.tsx`'s header
 *   comment, `:357`).
 * - `:308 rbacEnabled = !!entitlements?.rbac` — gates the PANE CONTENT, not
 *   visibility (`:536-544`). A non-entitled account sees `EnterpriseUpsell`
 *   in place of the real `GroupsTab` — the pane itself stays reachable —
 *   mirroring the server's `requireEntitlement('rbac')` 402 on the create
 *   route, so an admin never touches a control the backend would reject.
 * - `:310 entitlementsLoading = !entitlements && accountStateQuery.isLoading`
 *   — while the account-state query is in flight, `:534-535` renders a
 *   `Skeleton` — NEITHER the real pane nor the upsell. `GroupsTabInner`
 *   below folds in one more condition the source page never needed:
 *   `!resolvedAccountId` also counts as "loading". The source page never
 *   reaches this pane before `account` resolves (`page.tsx:406`), so its
 *   accountId is never transiently undefined; `useSettingsAccountId` can be,
 *   with no project open and the store fallback not yet hydrated (see
 *   `../use-settings-account-id.ts`'s header comment) — without this fold-in
 *   a mid-resolution mount would flash the Enterprise upsell for one frame
 *   even on an entitled account, exactly the bug the brief calls out.
 *
 * `canCreate` is sourced from `usePermission(resolvedAccountId,
 * 'group.create')` — the same `group.create` leaf the source page batches
 * into `ACCOUNT_PERMISSION_PROBES` (`page.tsx:141`), as its own probe here
 * since this task has no sibling leaves to batch it with.
 *
 * **Account id.** `useSettingsAccountId(accountId)` — same shape as every
 * other Phase 3 tab; never `project?.account_id` alone (see
 * `../use-settings-account-id.ts`'s header comment for why the fallback
 * exists).
 *
 * **The group detail page — decision, not deferral (see the task report for
 * the full reasoning).** `RealGroupsTab` still navigates to
 * `/accounts/${accountId}/groups/${groupId}` on row click and on create
 * (`components/iam/groups-tab.tsx:226,334`, unmodified) — that route
 * (`app/(app)/accounts/[id]/groups/[groupId]/page.tsx`, 1117 lines) is
 * untouched by this task and still live, so the link keeps working today
 * exactly as before. It should be RECREATED at `/settings/groups/[groupId]`
 * as its own standalone (non-modal) page once `/accounts/**` is deleted —
 * it is too large and too stateful (member/project-grant management, its
 * own sub-navigation) to fold into a `SettingsTabPane` the way this file's
 * list view could. This file makes no change toward that; it is out of
 * scope here.
 *
 * `GroupsTabView` is the pure, props-only half — no hooks, no data
 * fetching. `RealGroupsTab` renders through the `groupsSlot` prop, left
 * `undefined` by default — same pattern every other Phase 3 tab uses for its
 * hook-driven children.
 *
 * **Fix round 1 — the terminal no-account state.** `entitlementsLoading`
 * folds in `!resolvedAccountId` (see above) so a still-resolving accountId
 * shows a skeleton instead of flashing the upsell. But `useSettingsAccountId`
 * has no signal for "this will NEVER resolve" — if `resolvedAccountId` stays
 * `undefined` forever, that fold-in alone spins the skeleton forever too,
 * which is a worse failure mode: an indefinite spinner reads as "the app is
 * broken" without ever saying so. Traced whether that is reachable:
 *
 * - `GET /v1/accounts` (`listAccounts`, the query `resolvedAccountId`
 *   ultimately traces back to via `useCurrentAccountStore`) bootstraps a
 *   personal account SYNCHRONOUSLY, inside the same request, whenever the
 *   caller has zero memberships (`apps/api/src/accounts/core/accounts.ts:
 *   58,76-100` — `if (memberships.length > 0) {...} ` else
 *   `bootstrapPersonalAccount(...)`; the bootstrap itself is idempotent,
 *   `onConflictDoNothing` — `accounts/core/bootstrap-personal-account.ts:
 *   24-29`). So a SUCCESSFUL `listAccounts` response is never an empty
 *   array for an authenticated user — confirmed by reading the route, not
 *   assumed.
 * - `SettingsPanel` has TWO mounts, and both run the seeding query beside
 *   this tab. `ProjectShell` (`features/workspace/project-layout/
 *   project-shell.tsx:185,195` — `ProjectSidebar` and `SettingsPanel` as
 *   siblings) reaches it through `ProjectSidebar`, which renders
 *   `WorkspaceSwitcher` (`project-sidebar/project-sidebar.tsx:116`) — NOT a
 *   `UserMenu`; there is no `UserMenu` anywhere under `project-sidebar/`, its
 *   only mount being the app header (`features/layout/app-header.tsx:108`),
 *   which only the `app/(app)/accounts` tree renders. `app/(app)/settings*`
 *   renders `StandaloneSettingsRoute`, which has no sidebar at all and calls
 *   the hook itself. Both reach the same `['accounts']` query and the same
 *   self-heal, because it was extracted out of `UserMenu` into
 *   `hooks/account/use-ensure-selected-account.ts` and every such surface
 *   calls it. (JAY-547 — before that, the standalone route bounced to a
 *   project route instead of mounting the panel, so the sidebar was the only
 *   path.)
 *
 * Conclusion: "resolved to genuinely zero accounts" is unreachable for a
 * successful fetch — but the FETCH ITSELF can fail (network/API outage) and
 * never resolve, which never triggers the self-heal and leaves
 * `resolvedAccountId` `undefined` forever. That failure mode IS reachable.
 * `GroupsTabInner` below runs its own `['accounts']` query (same key as
 * `UserMenu`'s — react-query dedupes it into the same cache entry rather
 * than firing a second request in every reachable mount path) purely to
 * detect this: `accountResolutionFailed` is true once auth has settled and
 * that query has itself settled (not loading) with either an error or,
 * defensively, zero rows. `GroupsTabView` renders an honest `ErrorState`
 * instead of an indefinite skeleton in that case — cheap insurance for a
 * branch proven unreachable via the happy path, in case the trace above is
 * ever wrong.
 *

 * **Untestable here, by design (see the task brief's constraints):** the
 * actual create/delete-group network round trips, the search-filter
 * interaction, and the row-click navigation to the group detail page all
 * need a live network, `next/navigation`, and a real DOM. `bun test` has no
 * DOM. `groups-tab.test.tsx` covers what the pure view can prove statically:
 * which of the skeleton / `EnterpriseUpsell` / the real slot renders for
 * each of the three gate states — it does not, and cannot, click a row or
 * observe a network call.
