/**
 * `MembersTabInner` (`members-tab.tsx`) consumes the Cmd+K "Invite members"
 * deep link (`command-palette.tsx:1146`,
 * `openSettings('members', { membersTab: 'invite' })`) via a `useEffect`
 * that calls `consumeMembersTabIntent` and, on a non-null result, sets
 * `inviteOpen` to open `InviteMemberDialog`. That producer never stopped
 * firing when `MembersView` (the previous consumer) was unmounted by this
 * task's rewire — the intent was set and silently dropped. This is the
 * regression test for that: the fix is real, and this pins it.
 *
 * `MembersTabInner` itself can't render under `renderToStaticMarkup` (it
 * needs `SettingsNavProvider` + `QueryClientProvider`, same hard DOM
 * constraint every other tab in this file documents), so this test exercises
 * `consumeMembersTabIntent` — the exact pure function the effect calls,
 * imported from `members-view.tsx` where it's already defined and tested
 * (`members-view.test.ts`'s "reviewer-found sequence", the original JAY-530
 * fix) — against the REAL `useSettingsPanelStore`, reproducing the actual
 * Cmd+K → Members-tab-mount → re-render sequence. `MembersTabInner`'s
 * `if (consumed) setInviteOpen(true)` is a one-line, unconditional pass-through
 * of this return value, so pinning `consumeMembersTabIntent`'s consume-and-
 * clear behavior for THIS call shape closes the loop on the wiring's
 * correctness without needing a DOM to prove the `setInviteOpen` call itself
 * fired — same caveat `members-view.test.ts` already carried for its own
 * `if (consumed) setTab(consumed)` line, never separately DOM-tested either.
