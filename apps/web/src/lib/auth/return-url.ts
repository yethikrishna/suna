 * (e.g. http://localhost:3000, not a configured staging APP_URL). But on a
 * self-host instance the frontend runs as a Next.js standalone server bound to

 * resolves to the internal wildcard BIND address `https://0.0.0.0:3000` instead

 * after they authenticate (observed live: SSO on a self-host landing on
 * `https://0.0.0.0:3000/projects?auth_event=signup&auth_method=sso:...`).
 *
 * A wildcard bind address (0.0.0.0 / [::]) and an AWS private compute hostname
 * are never client-facing origins. ECS can expose the latter as
 * `ip-10-…us-west-2.compute.internal:3000` even when an ALB received the public
 * request. In both cases, fall back to the configured public APP_URL. Loopback
 * (localhost / 127.0.0.1) stays unchanged so local development remains local.
