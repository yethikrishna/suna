/**
 * How long each step may hold up the exit, in milliseconds. Worst case is

 * network HTTP error (a 500), not only on a hang — so `endSession` can
 * genuinely run twice. `finalizeServerSession + endSession + endSession +
 * resetClientState` = 3.0 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 = 8.0s. See `runSignOut`.
 *
 * They are not the same number, and the differences are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - **3000 for the server revoke**, matching `finalizeServerSignOut`'s own
 *    `AbortSignal.timeout(3_000)`. A tighter outer bound would mean that inner
 *    abort could never fire while anyone waits, and — because `withTimeBudget`
 *    does not CANCEL anything — the request would only land at all because the
 *    remaining steps happen to keep the document alive long enough. That is
 *    accidental coupling: every second cut from the tail would silently remove
 *    grace from an in-flight revoke. Equal budgets make the guarantee explicit.
 *  - **2000 for the sign-out**, the one step whose success is the whole point.
 *  - **1000 for the reset**, which is generous rather than tight:
 *    `clearSessionIDBCache` issues `tx.objectStore(STORE_NAME).clear()` and
 *    returns WITHOUT awaiting the transaction, so the only awaited work is
 *    `openDB()`. Cache size is irrelevant — a 10-entry and a 10,000-entry cache
 *    settle identically, and the only thing 1000ms is really waiting out is the
 *    blocked-upgrade hang that has no upper bound at all.

/**
 * Run one sign-out.
 *
 * Four properties this holds that no previous logout path did:
 *
 *  1. **The error is READ, and the session is ENDED even when reading it is not
 *     enough.** `signOut()` returns `{ error }` rather than throwing, and every
 *     previous caller dropped it. On that path Supabase removed no session,
 *     fired no `SIGNED_OUT`, and cleared nothing — and the user was navigated to
 *     `/auth` as though it had worked, where the still live session sent them
 *     straight back into the app.
 *
 *     Reading the error buys a retry with `scope: 'local'`, and that retry is
 *     worth taking — but it is NOT the guarantee it looks like. `scope: 'local'`
 *     still posts to `/logout` and still bails before removing the session on a
 *     non-404/401/403 error, so offline and 5xx defeat both calls. The
 *     guarantee comes from `dropAuthCookie()`, which runs whenever the session
 *     is not PROVEN gone: a returned error, a thrown fetch, or a timeout, on
 *     either attempt.
 *
 *     The retry is SKIPPED when the first attempt already proved the network is
 *     the problem — a timeout, or a settled `AuthRetryableFetchError` — because
 *     `scope: 'local'` makes the same request to the same host and can only
 *     fail the same way, one budget later. It is KEPT for any settled HTTP
 *     error: `scope: 'global'` revokes every refresh token for the user, which
 *     is a heavier server write than `scope: 'local'`, so a global 500 beside a
 *     local 200 is not hypothetical.
 *  2. **The cleanup runs REGARDLESS.** `resetClientState()` is not conditional
 *     on the sign-out succeeding. The `SIGNED_OUT` listener in `AuthProvider`
 *     also resets, but it only fires when Supabase actually removed a session —
 *     which is exactly the case that already worked.
 *  3. **Leaving ALWAYS happens, on a WALL CLOCK.** Every step is bounded, not
 *     just guarded. A `try`/`catch` cannot rescue a promise that never settles,
 *     and one of these steps can genuinely hang forever: `resetClientState()`
 *     awaits `clearSessionIDBCache()`, whose `openDB()` has no `onblocked`
 *     handler, so a version upgrade blocked by a stale tab never resolves.
 *     Unbounded, the user could not sign out at all and saw no error.
 *
 *     Bounding is safe for a reason specific to this sequence: everything
 *     identity-critical in `resetClientState()` is SYNCHRONOUS and complete
 *     before its one awaited call — the React Query cache, the persisted
 *     account selection and the per-user localStorage are already gone. Only
 *     the IndexedDB purge can be outrun, and those entries are keyed
 *     `user:<id>` (`buildSessionCacheKey`), so the next account cannot read
 *     them.
 *  4. **Nothing is stranded, and a SECOND press still leaves.** `/new`'s button
 *     neither awaited nor navigated, so it signed the user out and left them on
 *     the create form. The re-entry branch below is the other half of that: it
 *     refuses to run a second sequence but still navigates, because a user can
 *     genuinely end up back here — press Log out with unsaved file edits open
 *     and the `beforeunload` prompt lets them press "Stay"
 *     (`file-viewer/file-content-renderer.tsx`). Returning silently left them
 *     signed out, inside the app, with a permanently disabled button and a
 *     route guard that had already stood down.
 *
 * Worst case before `leave()` is 8.0s, not the 6.0s sum of the three DISTINCT
 * budgets. The case that makes every step run long is NOT the same case that
 * skips the retry: a hang produces `{status: 'timeout'}`, which
 * `isNetworkClassFailure` does treat as network-class and skips the retry for
 * — but a SETTLED plain HTTP error (a 500) that happens to resolve near the
 * end of the first `endSession` budget is neither a timeout nor a settled
 * `AuthRetryableFetchError`, so it falls through to the retry, which gets its
 * OWN fresh `budgets.endSession` rather than whatever was left of the first.
 * That is `endSession` counted twice: `finalizeServerSession` (3.0) +
 * `endSession` (2.0) + the retry's `endSession` (2.0) + `resetClientState`
 * (1.0) = 8.0s.
