/**
 * A signup must never inherit the visitor's pre-signup return URL.
 *
 * `resolveNewAccountReturnUrl` holds the rule (see return-url.ts). This test is
 * the enforcement: the rule is only worth anything if EVERY path that turns an
 * authentication into a destination actually calls it. A path that quietly
 * stops calling it puts a brand-new account back on a stranger's "Request
 * access to this project" page, which is how this bug shipped in the first
 * place — the destination logic lives in four separate places and only the
 * invite case had ever been special-cased.
 *
 * Each entry names WHERE in that file the rule has to apply, so a rewrite that
 * moves the code still has to make a deliberate choice.
