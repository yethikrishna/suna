//   2. The SDK 10.x frames are mostly NAMED minified functions (`iX`, `iu`,
//      `ib`, `ik`, `oq`, `o_`, `l9`, `l`, `MessagePort.x`) with real linenos,

//      that's the call-site frame Better Stack surfaces — but the older
//      "all frames must be unresolved" rule no longer holds.
// The fix treats the literal `"No error message"` placeholder as equivalent
// to an empty message (it is Sentry's own "no message" marker, never a real
// app error message), and relaxes the frame guard from "every frame
// unresolved" to "no frame resolves to a first-party `apps/web/src/…` source
