 * Files, Connectors, Skills, and Commands are NOT customize sections — they
 * are standalone `/projects/[id]/<section>` pages (any member can browse
 * Files; Connectors/Skills/Commands gate on their own read leaf — see
 * capabilities/tabs.ts). Deep-link routes still accept the legacy section
 * names and redirect there.
