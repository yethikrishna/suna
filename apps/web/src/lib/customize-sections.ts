/**
 * Customize section identifiers + helpers.
 *
 * The /projects/[id]/customize page reads its active section from either the
 * path segment (`/customize/agents`) or the legacy `?section=` query param.
 * This module keeps the section enum, the default, and a parser in one spot
 * so the page, the sidebar, and any deep-link helpers all agree on the
 * canonical list.
 *
 * Files, Connectors, Skills, and Commands are NOT customize sections — they
 * are standalone `/projects/[id]/<section>` pages (any member can browse
 * Files; Connectors/Skills/Commands gate on their own read leaf — see
 * capabilities/tabs.ts). Deep-link routes still accept the legacy section
 * names and redirect there.
