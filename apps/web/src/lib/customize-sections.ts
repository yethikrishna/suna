/**
 * Customize section identifiers + helpers.
 *
 * The /projects/[id]/customize page reads its active section from either the
 * path segment (`/customize/agents`) or the legacy `?section=` query param.
 * This module keeps the section enum, the default, and a parser in one spot
 * so the page, the sidebar, and any deep-link helpers all agree on the
 * canonical list.
 *
 * Files, Agents, Connectors, and Skills are NOT customize sections — they are
 * standalone `/projects/[id]/<section>` pages (any member can browse Files;
 * Agents/Connectors/Skills gate on their own read leaf — see
 * capabilities/capability-tab-routes.ts). Commands is the one that came BACK:
 * its standalone page was deleted (#6169), so it lives in this overlay and its
 * deep link opens here rather than redirecting. Deep-link routes still accept
 * the legacy section names and redirect them where applicable.
