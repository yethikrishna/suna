/**
 * Icons for server components (RSC).
 *
 * React Server Components cannot read context, so IconProvider — which carries
 * the app-wide weight for the client tree — never reaches them. Phosphor's
 * context-free SSR entry defaults to "regular" instead, which would silently
 * ignore DEFAULT_ICON_WEIGHT.
 *
 * This module closes that gap: every icon below is the SSR icon with
 * DEFAULT_ICON_WEIGHT (src/lib/icons/icon-config.ts) already bound. Server
 * components import from here and, exactly like client components, never pass
 * a weight prop — one constant still governs the whole app. An explicit weight
 * (weight="fill" on solid/status icons) still wins.
 *
 * Adding an icon to a server component? Add its two lines here. Importing
 * '@phosphor-icons/react' directly in a server component crashes the build
 * (its main entry calls createContext at module scope).
