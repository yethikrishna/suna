 * Kortix-cloud-only feature flags.

 *
 * Add new flags here whenever cloud-specific copy, contact info, or branding
 * needs to be conditionally shown, so the gating logic lives in one place.

/**
 * Build-time gate for the founder's personal contact surfaces — the floating

 * the Support dialog, and any other "hey, I'm Marko" UI. Self-hosters should
 * never see the maintainer's face by default.
 *
 * Enable on the cloud frontend with: NEXT_PUBLIC_KORTIX_PERSONAL_CONTACT=true
 *
 * NOTE: this flag is the build-time gate only. To actually show the surfaces,
 * use the `useShowPersonalContact()` hook — it ANDs this flag with a paid-plan
 * check so the concierge is a perk for paying customers, not free accounts.
