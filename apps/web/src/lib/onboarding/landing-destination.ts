 * an OAuth signup arrives from the IdP, and a client-side redirect keeps

 * "a different user was here 30 seconds ago". They are opposite answers: the
 * first must return to the path, the second must never see it. Signing in as B
 * on a screen bounced from A's project sent B to A's "Request access" page,
 * because the only guard in place ran for brand-new accounts.
 *
 * The owner half is allowed to be EMPTY. Middleware does not always have a user
 * id to attach (the stale-session self-heal may have already nulled it), and a
 * pasted or bookmarked `/auth?redirect=…` link arrives with no cookie at all.
 * An empty owner means UNATTRIBUTED, which never demotes — see

 *
 * Accepted cost of the window: a bounce can outlive the navigation that caused
 * it, so a genuinely shared deep link opened within 300s of somebody else's
 * bounce is demoted once. Every successful sign-in clears the cookie, so
 * re-opening the link works immediately — it self-corrects, and erring toward
