/**
 * The removed `/projects` index took two query-string forms with it:
 * `?new=1` opened the create modal, `?clone=<id>` seeded it from a
 * marketplace item. Both now live on `/new` (see `clone-param.ts`).
 *
 * Scoped to the query-string forms deliberately, not to the bare `/projects`
 * string: `/projects` itself is still a real prefix for `/projects/:id`, so a
 * whole-string sweep cannot tell a destination (wrong, must repoint) from a
 * prefix/allowlist check (`startsWith('/projects')`, `pathname.indexOf(...)`)
 * that legitimately still matches every open project. `?new=1` and `?clone=`
 * have no such double meaning — nothing needs them to survive.
