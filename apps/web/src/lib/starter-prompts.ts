/**
 * Starter prompts surfaced in the onboarding wizard's "Try your first
 * request" step and on the project home composer suggestions.
 *
 * Each entry maps to a real starter skill that ships with every new Kortix
 * project (`packages/starter/templates/general-knowledge-worker/.kortix/
 * opencode/skills/`). Keep these worded as actual user requests, not
 * feature descriptions — they're meant to be clickable and immediately
 * useful for a non-technical founder.
 *
 * The first item is the meta-onboarding prompt: it kicks off a back-and-forth
 * where the agent asks about the user's company and writes the answers into
 * `.kortix/memory/` (eventually as a change request for review).
