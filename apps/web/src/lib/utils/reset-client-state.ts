/**
 * Wipe ALL client-side state tied to the signed-in user.
 *
 * Run on logout and whenever a *different* user signs in, so the next account
 * never inherits the previous one's data. Covers, in order:
 *   1. React Query cache — every cached server response (accounts, projects,
 *      sessions, billing, …). This is the big one that was missing.
 *   2. The persisted "current account" selection (zustand + its localStorage).
 *   3. Every OTHER persisted zustand store's IN-MEMORY state — via
 *      `resetAllRegisteredPersistedStores()`, see `persisted-store-registry.ts`
 *      — plus the SDK's impersonation session, which lives partly at module
 *      scope (`current`/`hydrated` in
 *      `packages/sdk/src/core/http/impersonation.ts`) and so cannot be forgotten
 *      by deleting its sessionStorage key alone.
 *   4. Remaining per-user localStorage AND sessionStorage — a PREFIX sweep,
 *      not a delete-list; see `clear-local-storage.ts`. Runs AFTER step 3 so a
 *      store that just had its in-memory state reset has nothing left to
 *      re-persist.
 *   5. The IndexedDB session-sync cache.
 *
 * Safe to call from anywhere (no React context needed) — the QueryClient is
 * read from the module-level singleton, so AuthProvider (mounted above the
 * React Query provider) can use it too.
 *
 * **Steps 1-4 are SYNCHRONOUS and always complete. Step 5 is bounded and may
 * be outrun.** That distinction is the contract, not an implementation detail:
 * callers await this before publishing a new identity, and `clearSessionIDBCache()`
 * can hang FOREVER — `openDB()` in `packages/sdk/src/browser/cache/idb-sync-cache.ts`
 * has no `onblocked` handler, so an `indexedDB.open` needing a version upgrade
 * while a stale tab holds the old version fires neither `success` nor `error`,
 * and the promise is memoized so every later caller parks behind it. Unbounded,
 * that meant a user could not sign out AND the app could park on its loading
 * frame at sign-in, with no error shown either way.
 *
 * Outrunning step 5 is safe because it purges INERT data: nothing in Kortix
 * reads those entries any more (see that module's own header), and they are
 * keyed `user:<id>` via `buildSessionCacheKey`, so the next account cannot read
 * them even if the purge never lands. Everything that would actually leak
 * across identities is already gone by then.
 *
 * Does NOT clear `kortix_last_project`. That cookie is owner-bound
 * (`<userId>:<projectId>`) and deliberately survives sign-out — the
 * middleware reads its owner half to attribute a post-logout bounce. See
 * `lib/onboarding/last-project-cookie.ts` and the tripwire test at
 * `lib/auth/sign-out-navigation.test.ts`.
