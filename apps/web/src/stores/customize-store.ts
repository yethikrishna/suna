 * Customize overlay store.

 * Customize is a full-screen overlay that floats over whatever project page is
 * active (a session, the project home, …) instead of a route that swaps the
 * content area and spawns a tab. Keeping the open/section state here lets every
 * trigger — the sidebar button, project-home tiles, the command palette, the
 * sandbox alert, deep-link routes — open the same surface without navigating,
 * so you never lose your place. ESC / backdrop closes it and you're exactly
 * where you were.
