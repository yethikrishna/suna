/**
 * The per-session message queue, persisted across reloads and tab switches.
 *
 * The rules live in `@kortix/sdk/message-queue` as pure transitions; this store
 * is the two things the SDK deliberately does not do — hold the state per
 * session, and write it to disk.
 *
 * Why it is a store and not `useState` in `SessionChat`: the queue used to be
 * component state, so switching session tabs destroyed every queued message
 * with no notice. Nothing announced the loss because nothing knew it happened.
 *
 * ## What survives a reload, and what does not
 *
 * Text, mentions, and the agent/model/variant captured at enqueue all persist.
 * `File` objects and `blob:` URLs cannot be serialized, so an attachment comes
 * back as `{ kind: 'lost' }` — a real member of the union, so the type system
 * makes the UI acknowledge it. Dropping the files silently and sending a
 * message the user believes carries them is the one outcome worth engineering
 * against.
 *
 * `inFlightId` is deliberately **not** persisted. The lock belongs to the tab
 * that owns the in-flight send; a reload means no send is on the wire, so the
 * queue must be claimable again rather than wedged behind a lock nobody holds.
 * The tradeoff is honest: a message whose send was accepted by the server in
 * the instant before a crash can be sent again on the next load. That is
 * at-least-once for a crash, versus never-again for every crash — and the
 * queue's whole purpose is not losing what you typed.
