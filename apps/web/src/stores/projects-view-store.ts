/**
 * How the Projects page groups its grid:
 *  - 'all'     → every account the user belongs to, grouped under account headers.
 *  - 'account' → just the currently-selected account (the classic single view).
 *
 * This is purely a *view* preference for the projects grid — it deliberately
 * does NOT touch the active account (current-account-store). Account-scoped
 * surfaces (billing, settings, members) always read a concrete account from the
 * switcher, so they're unaffected by an "all accounts" browse. Defaults to 'all'
 * so a freshly-invited member sees the project they joined without first having
 * to discover and switch accounts.
