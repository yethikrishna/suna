 * Which of the two connector access modes this instance is running.
 *
 * They use different credential and ownership boundaries:
 *
 *   - BACKEND (wrapper / KaaB): the server holds ONE Kortix key, every upstream
 *     call goes through this app's proxy, and local policy enforces project
 *     ownership and request limits.
 *   - DIRECT (SDK-only): the browser talks to Kortix with a key the user pasted.
 *     There is no wrapper authentication or local project ownership policy.
 *
 * A missing `KORTIX_API_KEY` silently falls back to DIRECT, so the badge is also
 * the fastest way to see that the server env did not load.
