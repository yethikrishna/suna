/**
 * Human-in-the-loop, read out of what the platform actually returns.
 *
 * Two upstream surfaces, deliberately not interchangeable:
 *
 * - READ is the per-SESSION audit (`GET /projects/{id}/sessions/{sid}/audit`),
 *   not the project-wide approval inbox. The inbox is manager-scoped and
 *   returns every end-user's pending gate; in wrapper mode ONE operator
 *   credential makes every call, so that inbox would hand this browser other
 *   Lumen users' execution ids — and an execution id is all the resolve route
 *   needs. The per-session audit is bounded to the session already on screen,
 *   so it is the only read that cannot leak across end-users.
 * - RESOLVE is `POST /projects/{id}/approvals/{executionId}` — the only route
 *   that decides a gate.
 *
 * `audit_access` is an Enterprise entitlement: without it the trail degrades to
 * unresolved pending approvals only (never a 402 — the approval control plane
 * has to keep working on every tier). That is a different statement from "this
 * session did nothing else", so the panel has to be told which it is looking at.
