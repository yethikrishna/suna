/**
 * What to tell someone about a connector they cannot bind.
 *
 * "Your own account" vs "a project connection" is the thing people
 * get wrong about connectors in wrapper mode, so the copy names the distinction
 * instead of saying "no connections available".
 *
 * `selfServiceAction` is typed `null` on purpose. A wrapper acts under one
 * credential for many end-users, so there is no personal upstream identity to
 * connect WITH — the interactive flow that would do it (`require_connectors`)
 * is refused for a wrapper credential outright
 * (403 REQUIRE_CONNECTORS_INTERACTIVE_ONLY). A "connect it yourself" button
 * here could only ever lead to that refusal, so the type forbids one existing.
