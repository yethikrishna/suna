## 0. TL;DR

**The ask:** Inside a single project, scope resources & config to roles/users/groups, and let a role have capabilities **deactivated** (Git Ops, Schedules, Webhooks, Customize sections…). Driving use case: **one big company project** with **departments scoped inside it** (e.g. 10 Marketing members who can act in their slice without seeing/touching the rest) — instead of one repo per department.

**The reality (verified):** The IAM engine is already Cloudflare-shaped and ~70% there — but it has **two structural gaps** that make intra-project scoping impossible today:

1. **Everything below the project collapses to `project.read` / `project.write`.** `loadProjectForUser(c, id, 'read'|'write'|'manage')` is the gate for Agents, Skills, Commands, Schedules, Webhooks, Files, Customize, Git Ops — and `manage` even maps to `project.write` ([access.ts:238](apps/api/src/projects/lib/access.ts)). There are **no per-capability action strings**, so there is nothing to toggle.
2. **Roles are 6 frozen `Set`s in code**, not data ([role-perms.ts:57,102](apps/api/src/iam/role-perms.ts)). The `role.*` / `policy.*` actions ([actions.ts:45-52](apps/api/src/iam/actions.ts)), the `VALID_ACTIONS` custom-role validator ([actions.ts:133](apps/api/src/iam/actions.ts)), and `ACTION_CATALOG` ([actions.ts:157](apps/api/src/iam/actions.ts)) are **reserved with zero engine consumers**. No custom/department roles exist.

**The unlock (verified, and the reason this is "activate + extend", not greenfield):** the frontend **already ships a complete IAM management SDK** — [`apps/web/src/lib/iam-client.ts`](apps/web/src/lib/iam-client.ts) defines `IamRole`, `IamPolicy`, `PrincipalType`, `PolicyScopeType`, `ActionCatalogEntry`, and calls `GET/POST /accounts/:id/iam/roles`, `PUT /iam/roles/:id/permissions`, `GET /iam/actions`, full `/iam/policies` CRUD + `:bulk-import` + `:simulate` + `roles/:id/usage`. **Those backend routes 404 today.** The contract is pre-designed; we build the backend to match it and wire the engine to read it.

**Strategy:** stay **allow-only, highest-wins** for v1 (no explicit deny — reserved for v2). Built-in roles become **seed rows** so the engine has one code path. Every phase ships independently and is **backward-compatible (no lockout)**.

---

## 1. Verified current state (with file:line)

### 1.1 The engine — `authorizeV2` ([engine-v2.ts:274](apps/api/src/iam/engine-v2.ts))
- Single role, **allow-only, highest-wins**. No deny, no conditions. V1 policy engine retired (`engine.ts` is type-only).
- `scopeForActionV2` ([engine-v2.ts:53](apps/api/src/iam/engine-v2.ts)) = **prefix switch**: `account.*/billing.*/audit.*/member.*/group.*/role.*/policy.*/token.*` → `account`; **everything else → `project`**. (Good: new `project.agent.*` etc. fall through to `project` automatically.)
- Decision = `PROJECT_ROLE_PERMS[effectiveRole].has(action)` (project) / `ACCOUNT_ROLE_PERMS[role].has(action)` (account) ([role-perms.ts:132-139](apps/api/src/iam/role-perms.ts)).
- **Role merge** `deriveEffectiveProjectRole` ([engine-v2.ts:78](apps/api/src/iam/engine-v2.ts)): fold the implicit account role (owner/admin → `manager`), the direct `project_members` row, and every `project_group_grants` row via `maxProjectRole` (viewer<editor<manager). **No source can subtract.**
- **Owner / admin / super_admin bypass ALL project gates** ([engine-v2.ts:304](apps/api/src/iam/engine-v2.ts), `loadEffectiveProjectRole:224`). → Department isolation cannot contain an account owner/admin (see Open Q1).
- Public API (`iam/index.ts` → [dispatcher.ts](apps/api/src/iam/dispatcher.ts)): `authorize()`, `assertAuthorized()` (403 on deny), `listAccessibleResources()`. The dominant project gate is `loadProjectForUser` ([access.ts:265](apps/api/src/projects/lib/access.ts)).

### 1.2 The collapse point ([access.ts:238](apps/api/src/projects/lib/access.ts)) — verified verbatim
```
read   → project.read
write  → project.write
manage → project.write   // "editors aren't accidentally locked out"; stricter routes add an explicit assertAuthorized on top
```
So **every feature route bottoms out at `project.read` or `project.write`** (r3/r4/r5/r8/r9/r10). The Members surface ([r6.ts](apps/api/src/projects/routes/r6.ts)) is the **proven pattern** for stricter gating: `loadProjectForUser('write')` + an explicit `assertAuthorized(...members.manage)`.

### 1.3 Roles & actions
- 6 roles as **additive slices** ([role-perms.ts](apps/api/src/iam/role-perms.ts)): account `MEMBER_BASELINE` + `ADMIN_EXTRAS` + `OWNER_ONLY`; project `VIEWER_BASELINE` + `EDITOR_EXTRAS` + `MANAGER_ONLY`. (Additive shape = trivial to seed into `iam_role_actions`.)
- Reserved & dark: `ROLE_*` / `POLICY_*` actions, `VALID_ACTIONS`, `ACTION_CATALOG` — present, consumed by nothing except a negative validator at `agents.ts:305`.
- **Confirmed absent in schema** (`packages/db/src/schema/kortix.ts`): `iam_roles`, `iam_policies`, **and the `iam_resource_type` pg enum** (prior memory was wrong — `RESOURCE_TYPES` is TS-only; `resource_type` columns are plain `text`).

### 1.4 The pre-built frontend contract ([iam-client.ts](apps/web/src/lib/iam-client.ts))
`IamRole` (:40), `IamPolicy` (:67, fields `principal_type / principal_id / scope_type / scope_id`), `ActionCatalogEntry` (:364), `createRole / updateRolePermissions / listActions / createPolicy / bulk-import / simulate / role usage`. **No `.tsx` consumes it yet** — UI components are also to-build, but the **types + endpoint contract are fixed**, which pins our table shapes and route signatures.

### 1.5 The cache bug ([engine-v2.ts:151/169/239](apps/api/src/iam/engine-v2.ts), [access.ts:101](apps/api/src/projects/lib/access.ts))
Four uncoordinated `ttlMemo` instances, TTL ~15s, **positive-only caching**, and **nothing ever calls `.clear()`** → a revoke/demote/group-removal lags up to 15s across replicas. Until fixed, **no gate is a real security boundary**. `ttl-memo.ts` already has `.clear()` (:85) but no keyed invalidation.

### 1.6 The bypass seams (where "deactivate" becomes cosmetic if missed)
- **Git proxy**: `authorizeGitProxy` ([git.ts:579](apps/api/src/projects/git.ts)) takes `_scope` (**unused**), authorizes read==write on account-ownership; comment defers role gating to "M2". **This is M2.**
- **Automation**: `fireGitTrigger` ([triggers.ts:606](apps/api/src/projects/triggers.ts)) resolves the owner actor then calls `createSession`/`continueSession` with **no `assertAuthorized`** → a trigger owned by a now-restricted user still runs full-power.
- **Service accounts**: `middleware/auth.ts:120` sets `userId = service_account_id`, but `resolveActorV2Uncached` ([engine-v2.ts:120](apps/api/src/iam/engine-v2.ts)) queries `account_members` by userId only → SAs resolve `not_a_member`. Bridged via `iam_policies(principal_type='token')`.

---

## 2. Target data model (additive; mirrors the pre-built `iam-client` contract)

All account-scoped, nullable-safe, copying existing patterns (`project_secret_grants`, `project_group_grants`). Edit `packages/db/src/schema/kortix.ts` → `pnpm migrate:generate <slug>` → review SQL → commit **both** `.sql` and the drizzle snapshot (per [MIGRATIONS.md](packages/db/MIGRATIONS.md)). **Use the `migration` skill.**

| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
|---|---|---|
| `iam_roles` | DB-driven roles (custom + the 6 built-ins as `is_builtin` seeds) | `role_id`, `account_id`, `key`, `name`, `description`, `scope_type('account'\|'project')`, `is_builtin`, `built_in_key`, `created_by`, ts; `unique(account_id,key)` |
| `iam_role_actions` | role → leaf action set (the capability list) | `role_id`, `action varchar(96)` (validated vs `VALID_ACTIONS`); PK(`role_id`,`action`) |
| `iam_policies` | bind principal → role @ scope (the assignment) | `policy_id`, `account_id`, `principal_type('member'\|'group'\|'token')`, `principal_id`, `role_id`, `scope_type('account'\|'project')`, `scope_id`(nullable→account-wide), `expires_at`(nullable), `granted_by`, ts |
| `iam_resource_grants` *(Phase 4)* | per-resource sub-project scoping; generalizes the secret/session/connector grant triad | `grant_id`, `account_id`, `project_id`, `resource_type`(enum), `resource_id`(uuid or path/slug), `principal_type`, `principal_id`, `effect`(reuse `scope_effect` enum), ts; `unique(project_id,resource_type,resource_id,principal_type,principal_id)` |

**New enum `iam_resource_type`** (forward-only `CREATE TYPE`, safe): `account, project, sandbox, trigger, channel, member, group` + new leaves `agent, skill, command, schedule, webhook, file, customize, gitops, secret, connector`. Mirror these into `RESOURCE_TYPES` ([actions.ts:9](apps/api/src/iam/actions.ts)) so `resourceTypeForAction` derives them.

**Seeding:** a data migration inserts `is_builtin=true` rows + `iam_role_actions` for the 6 roles **sourced verbatim from the role-perms.ts Sets**, so the DB path and the frozen-Set path are **byte-identical** (the cutover correctness test). `project_members` / `project_group_grants` stay the canonical **fast path**; `iam_policies` is consulted **additively (union)** — nothing existing breaks.

**Do NOT** add a 4th `project_role` enum value for the "User/Operator" tier. Model read+run as a **seeded custom role** (`key='user'`: read leaves + `session.start/exec/stop` + `trigger.fire`). Ships as data, no enum migration.

---

## 3. Action catalog (the granularity that makes "deactivate" possible)

Add to `PROJECT_ACTIONS` ([actions.ts:68](apps/api/src/iam/actions.ts)), `resource.verb[.subresource]`:

| Resource | read → VIEWER | write/verb → EDITOR |
|---|---|---|
| Agents | `project.agent.read` | `project.agent.write` |
| Skills | `project.skill.read` | `project.skill.write` |
| Commands | `project.command.read` | `project.command.write` |
| Schedules (cron config) | `project.schedule.read` | `project.schedule.write` |
| Webhooks (config only¹) | `project.webhook.read` | `project.webhook.write` |
| Files | `project.file.read` | `project.file.write` |
| Customize config | `project.customize.read` | `project.customize.write` |
| Git Ops (human side²) | `project.gitops.read` | `project.gitops.push`, `project.gitops.merge` |
| Secrets | `project.secret.read` | `project.secret.write` |
| Connectors | `project.connector.read` | `project.connector.write` |

¹ The inbound webhook **fire** path ([r1.ts:60](apps/api/src/projects/routes/r1.ts)) stays HMAC-authed — no user IAM. Only **config** is gated.
² `project.cr.open` / `project.cr.merge` already exist but are asserted for the **agent** scope only (r8/r9). The `gitops.*` leaves are the **human** gates.

**Backward-compat rule (non-negotiable):** every new WRITE leaf is added to `EDITOR_EXTRAS` and every READ leaf to `VIEWER_BASELINE` in the same change. Existing editors/managers keep **all** current capability. "Deactivate Git Ops" then = a **custom role that OMITS** `project.gitops.*`, never removing it from editor. (If you skip this, the 15s cache hides the regression in manual testing and editors get locked out on cache expiry.)

Also: wire `ROLE_* / POLICY_*` into `ADMIN_EXTRAS` (account) so admins can manage roles/policies; keep `VALID_ACTIONS` as the **write-time validator** for `iam_role_actions`.

---

## 4. Engine wiring (extend `authorizeV2`, don't replace)

1. `scopeForActionV2` unchanged (new project leaves already fall through to `project`).
2. Replace the single `Set.has()` with **`resolveEffectiveActions(actor, accountId, scope, target) → ReadonlySet<string>`**:
   - (a) start with the **frozen-Set** actions for the actor's built-in role (unchanged path — guarantees backward-compat),
   - (b) **UNION** in actions from every `iam_policies` row matching (principal = user **or** in `actor.groupIds` **or** = acting token) AND scope (account-wide applies everywhere; project where `scope_id = target.id`), resolving `role_id → iam_role_actions`; expired filtered in SQL,
   - (c) `effectiveActions.has(action)`.
3. **Hot-path guard:** add `resolveActorV2.hasCustomPolicies` (one cheap boolean) so accounts with no custom roles **skip the policy join entirely**. Built-in roles keep using the in-memory fast path.
4. Owner/admin/super_admin bypass **preserved exactly**.
5. **Cache revoke-invalidation** (the security fix): add `.invalidate(key)` / `.invalidateByPrefix(prefix)` to `ttl-memo.ts`; register the 4 IAM memos; invalidate on **every** grant/revoke — `grantProjectRole` ([access.ts:120]), group-grant CRUD (r7), group-membership writes (`scim/groups.ts`, `sso-sync.ts diffSsoGroups`, `accounts/iam/groups.ts`), and the new `iam_policies/iam_role_actions` writes. On a member change invalidate `${userId}|*` + `*|${projectId}|*`; on a group change invalidate all its members.

---

## 5. Three enforcement seams — **move together or a deactivation is cosmetic**

This is the single biggest correctness risk. A file-based resource (agents/skills/commands/memory) is committed via git/CR, so an API gate alone is bypassable via raw `git push`.

1. **API routes** (primary): copy the r6 Members pattern — `loadProjectForUser('write')` + explicit `assertAuthorized(leaf, {type:'project', id})`. Cover the **CR-merge path** too, not just direct edits.
2. **Sandbox / git-proxy** (Phase 4): `authorizeGitProxy` consumes the `GitScope` it already receives (receive-pack=write/upload-pack=read are already split at `git-proxy/index.ts:168`); gate write/push on the launching user's `project.gitops.push`; **stamp role caps into the session token** at mint (`session-sandbox.ts:106`, where `agentGrant` is already stamped). **DEFAULT-ALLOW legacy tokens with no caps stamped** or you break the entire boot fleet.
3. **Automation / tokens** (Phase 4): stamp the trigger owner's effective caps onto spawned session tokens; bridge service accounts via `iam_policies(principal_type='token')` with a **safe default** so Slack/cron don't 403.
4. **Frontend** (Phase 3): `useProjectCan(projectId, action)` via a **`:batch` probe** (one call, not ~13 fan-out per overlay open); map each of the 16 `CustomizeSection` → leaf action; gate the **rail item AND the deep-link route**; **default-hide on load/error**; invalidate iam-permission query keys on mutation; remove the dead `useCan` path.

**Department scoping path (the headline):** department = `account_group` (exists). Bind: `iam_policies{principal_type:'group', principal_id:group_id, role_id: Marketing-role, scope_type:'project', scope_id: company_project}`. SSO/SCIM already provision group membership end-to-end (`sso-sync.ts diffSsoGroups`, `scim/groups.ts`). "Can't **see** the rest" needs `iam_resource_grants` with **fail-CLOSED** default → Phase 4.

---

## 6. Phased rollout (each phase ships independently, backward-compatible)

| Phase | Goal | Ships | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 — Cache revoke-invalidation** | Every grant/revoke takes effect immediately (any gate becomes a real boundary) | `ttl-memo` keyed invalidation + wire into all grant/group mutations + e2e asserting immediacy | **Low** — over-invalidation just costs a cache miss |
| **1 — Leaf actions + route gates** | Mint per-capability leaves; route each through explicit `assertAuthorized`; editors keep everything | `actions.ts` leaves + `RESOURCE_TYPES`; add to `EDITOR_EXTRAS`/`VIEWER_BASELINE`; migrate r3/r4/r5/r8/r9/r10 gates per-capability | **Med-High** — ~131 `loadProjectForUser` callsites; a missed route fails **open** to `project.write`. `e2e-projects-contract` mocks `assertAuthorized` to no-op (won't catch) → **live ke2e suite is the guard**. Migrate per-capability, not big-bang |
| **2 — DB custom roles** | Engine reads roles from DB; 6 built-ins seeded as `is_builtin`; enables capability deactivation | `iam_roles`+`iam_role_actions`+enum (migration); seed migration; `resolveEffectiveActions` union + `hasCustomPolicies`; build the dark `/iam/roles`, `/iam/roles/:id/permissions`, `/iam/actions` backend; gate on `ROLE_*` | **Med** — touches hot authorize path. Mitigate: `hasCustomPolicies` short-circuit + **seed-equality test** (DB path == frozen-Set path for built-ins) |
| **3 — Policies + dept scoping + frontend** | Assign roles to members/groups @ project scope; the "one company project, scoped departments" flow + capability-toggle UI; seed read+run "User" role | `iam_policies` + engine union; `/iam/policies` CRUD; Roles tab + action-catalog checkbox matrix (wire dark `iam-client`); `useProjectCan` section gating; SA bridge | **Med** — wrong section→action map can hide sections from legit managers (gate rail + deep-link together, default-hide); SA bridge must default-allow legacy |
| **4 — Bypass seams + per-resource grants** | Enforce caps sandbox-side; resource-subset isolation (fail-closed) for true "can't see the rest" | `authorizeGitProxy` honors `GitScope` + token caps (default-allow legacy); trigger/SA cap stamping; `iam_resource_grants` + `isResourceAccessibleBy` (lift `share.ts`); group tab in SharingPicker | **High** — `authorizeGitProxy` is the auth point for **all** git traffic; too-strict breaks clone/push on every boot. **Ship behind a per-account flag; default-allow legacy** |

**Minimum to satisfy the headline ask:** Phases 0–3 deliver "one company project + departments via group + scoped custom role, with capabilities deactivated." Phase 4 (per-resource visibility isolation) is the highest-risk, lowest-certainty work — **defer unless "can't SEE the rest of the resources" (not just "can't touch") is a hard v1 requirement** (Open Q8).

---

## 7. Open product decisions for Ino (with recommendations)

1. **Owner/admin bypass:** owners/admins/super-admins bypass all project gates by design — department isolation only contains plain members + custom-role holders. Accept for v1, or build a "restricted admin"? → **Recommend accept** (big design fork otherwise).
2. **Deactivation semantics under union:** v1 is union/highest-wins, so a Marketing role that omits Git Ops gives **no** protection if the user **also** has plain editor via another group. Is "this role lacks it" enough, or do you need "this user is denied project-wide" (= explicit DENY, a v2 item)? → **Recommend v1 = union-only, documented; deny in v2.**
3. **`manage`→`project.write` collapse:** keep + add explicit leaf asserts (low risk, chosen here) vs. introduce a real `project.manage` and re-audit 47 callsites? → **Recommend keep-collapse.**
4. **"User/Operator" tier contents:** read-everything + `session.start/exec/stop` + `trigger.fire`? Also `connector.read`? `secret.read` (probably **not**)? → Need your persona definition for the 10-Marketing-operator.
5. **File-based resource keys:** `iam_resource_grants.resource_id` for agents/skills/commands uses **path/slug** (`.opencode/agent/*`, `kortix.yaml agents:`). Confirm the path convention is stable enough to key grants on, or do we need a resource registry first?
6. **Service-account default role:** what baseline should an unscoped SA get so existing Slack/automation doesn't break while we bridge `principal_type='token'`?
7. **Per-resource grant default = fail-CLOSED** (resource with any grant denies non-granted members) — inverts the existing `share.ts` "empty list = whole project". Confirm, and confirm it's scoped to **only** the new `iam_resource_grants` (don't change existing secret/session sharing defaults or you silently lock existing shares).
8. **Is Phase 4 (per-resource visibility) in v1?** Or do dept-as-group + scoped role (Phases 1–3) satisfy "one company project with departments"?

---

## 8. Risks & testing

- **Fail-open on a missed route** (Phase 1): a capability route not migrated keeps `project.write` (editor has it) — safe-ish but means the deactivation silently doesn't apply. The **route manifest / ke2e coverage gate** + `spec/end-to-end.md` updates per changed gate are the guard; the contract test's no-op `assertAuthorized` mock will NOT catch it.
- **Hot-path latency** (Phase 2): the policy join must be skipped via `hasCustomPolicies` for the common (no-custom-roles) account.
- **Seed equality** (Phase 2): a test must assert the DB-resolved action set for each built-in == the frozen-Set, both before and after cutover.
- **git-proxy blast radius** (Phase 4): default-allow legacy tokens + per-account flag; one too-strict gate breaks every session boot's clone/push.
- **Cache over-invalidation** (Phase 0): only costs a DB roundtrip — acceptable.
- Test layers: unit (engine resolve, seed equality, action-catalog completeness) + e2e (`e2e-projects-contract`, `unit-iam-*`, `unit-agent-scope`) + **live ke2e** (the real gate for route coverage). Reuse the `unit-iam-v2-engine` / `unit-iam-v2-role-perms` patterns.

---

## 9. Execution checklist (for "we do it together")

- [ ] **Decisions first** — answer Open Qs 1–8 (esp. 2, 4, 8 — they change scope).
- [ ] **Phase 0** — `ttl-memo` keyed invalidation + wire into all grant/group mutations + revoke-immediacy e2e. *(Standalone, low risk — can land before any decision.)*
- [ ] **Phase 1** — leaf actions + `RESOURCE_TYPES`; add to `EDITOR_EXTRAS`/`VIEWER_BASELINE`; migrate gates per-capability with ke2e coverage each.
- [ ] **Phase 2** — migration (`iam_roles`/`iam_role_actions`/enum, via the `migration` skill) + seed + `resolveEffectiveActions` union + `hasCustomPolicies` + dark `/iam/roles`+`/iam/actions` backend + seed-equality test.
- [ ] **Phase 3** — `iam_policies` + engine union + `/iam/policies` CRUD + "User" seed role + Roles UI (wire dark `iam-client`) + `useProjectCan` section gating + SA bridge.
- [ ] **Phase 4 (optional/flagged)** — `authorizeGitProxy` + token cap stamping + `iam_resource_grants` fail-closed + group tab.

**Reusable templates to lift, not rebuild:** `project_secret_grants` + `share.ts isSecretUsableBy` (resource grants), the r6 Members `loadProjectForUser + assertAuthorized` pattern (route gates), `agent-scope.ts` (role ∩ grant), `project_group_grants` (group→project→role), the additive role slices (seeds), the pre-built `iam-client.ts` types/endpoints (the contract).

---

## 10. Implementation progress (branch `feat/iam-rbac-v1`)

**Decisions taken (per §7 recommendations; revisit Q4/Q8 together):** accept owner/admin bypass (Q1); v1 union-only deactivation (Q2); keep `manage`→`project.write` collapse (Q3); defer Phase 4 unless "can't SEE the rest" is hard-required (Q8).

### ✅ Done & committed (all additive, tsc-clean, unit-tested, no lockout risk)

- **Phase 0 — cache revoke-invalidation.** `ttl-memo` gains `invalidate(key)` / `invalidateByPrefix(prefix)`; new `iam/cache-invalidation.ts` registry (push-based, no import cycle); the 4 authz memos register; the project-member memo key is unified to `userId`-first so one prefix busts all. Wired into every revoke/demote/role-change site: `grantProjectRole`, project-member + group-grant CRUD (r6/r7), account member remove/role/leave, super-admin toggle, group-membership repo helpers, SCIM users+groups, SSO JIT sync. Grants stay instant (nulls uncached); expiry self-heals within the TTL. Tests: `unit-ttl-memo`, `unit-iam-cache-invalidation`.
- **Phase 1a — leaf catalog + role seeds.** Added `project.{agent,skill,command,schedule,webhook,file,customize,gitops,secret,connector}.{read,write}` (+ `gitops.push/merge`) to `PROJECT_ACTIONS`; seeded every write leaf into Editor and read leaf into Viewer so no current capability is lost. Guarded by a backward-compat invariant test in `unit-iam-v2-role-perms`.
- **Phase 1b — route gates (most capabilities).** Asserted leaf actions on every cleanly-routed capability (all behavior-identical for built-in roles → the hooks a custom role omits to deactivate): `project.gitops.merge` (CR merge, r9), `project.gitops.push` (CR create + commit-push, r8), `project.trigger.fire` (manual fire, r4), `project.secret.write` (secret create/delete, r3), `project.connector.write` (OAuth disconnect, r3). Left ungated by design: OAuth **connect** (it's `'read'` today — gating would tighten/lock-out viewers) and file-based agent/skill/command/memory writes (git files via the CR path → covered by `gitops.push`; per-type granularity is Phase 4).
- **Phase 2 — DB custom roles + engine union.** Migration `iam_roles` + `iam_role_actions` + `iam_policies` (with a **collision guard** dropping any dead V1 `iam_roles`/`iam_policies` first — review before deploy). Engine: `resolveActorV2` also loads the actor's policy action set (member + group, self-contained subquery → same parallel batch, `[]` for no-custom-role accounts); `authorizeV2` + `listAccessibleProjectsV2` union it allow-only with the built-in role. Pure `customPolicyAllows` unit-tested.
- **Phase 3 (backend) — role + policy management API.** Built the dark `/iam/roles` (list/create/patch/delete + `/:id/permissions` GET/PUT + `/:id/usage`), `/iam/actions`, and `/iam/policies` (list/create/**patch**/delete + `:bulk-delete` + `:bulk-import`) routes to the frontend SDK's exact contract; built-in presets incl. the read+run **"User"** tier; `ROLE_*`/`POLICY_*` wired into `ADMIN_EXTRAS`; allow-only (`effect=allow`, conditions ignored); every mutation busts the affected principals' cache (`invalidateIamCacheForRole`/`…ForPolicyPrincipal`). Pure presets + validator unit-tested. **162 IAM/auth tests green; all 3 typechecks clean; migration lints.**

**Decisions taken this round:** "User" tier = Viewer reads + `session.start/exec/stop` + `trigger.fire` (Q4); Phase 4 deferred (Q8); SA-token policy principal accepted by the schema but the engine union currently resolves member + group only (token/SA bridge = follow-up).

### ✅ Agent-side IAM hardening (security pass — 23 findings, verified)

An adversarial review (5 attack surfaces, each finding independently verified) found that agent-session token scoping was largely unenforced. Fixed the **CRITICAL + all HIGH** findings:
- **Warm-pool token had NO agentGrant (CRITICAL).** Every warm-served session (the common fast path) ran fully unscoped. Now the warm claim resolves + stamps the grant in parallel with the spare claim (no added latency).
- **Agent grant enforced centrally (root cause — closed ~9 per-route bypasses).** It was checked at only 2 routes (cr.open/merge); every other route (gitops, secrets, triggers, deploy, customize, members, sessions, snapshots, registry) was user-role-only. Folded into `authorizeV2`: `userRole ∩ agentGrant` now holds for every SPECIFIC project capability by construction (coarse read/write membership actions exempt). **Critical because automation sessions run AS AN ACCOUNT OWNER — the agent grant is their only containment.**
- **Per-agent secret/env isolation.** Every agent got ALL the launching user's secrets as `$ENV`. Added an `env` allowlist dimension to `[[agents]]`/`AgentGrant`; `buildSessionSandboxEnvVars` injects only the granted secrets, and `GET /secrets` filters + leaf-gates by it. (`env` defaults to `'all'` when omitted — back-compat; `[]` for unlisted-adopted agents.)
- Synced the manifest-schema grantable-action list (was missing gateway.* + the v1 leaves).

**Deferred (LOW, non-escalating):** validate `agent_name` against declared `[[agents]]` (#20 — already neutralized: an undeclared agent resolves to a default-DENY empty grant, not full access); re-resolve the grant on the trigger-reuse path (#21); cr.open/cr.merge role-set cleanup (#22).

**The headline use case works end-to-end at the API now:** create a Marketing custom role (omitting gitops/customize/etc.), `POST /iam/policies` binding the Marketing group → that role at the company-project scope, and the engine grants Marketing members exactly those actions, blocks the omitted capabilities, and busts caches on every change.

### ✅ Exhaustive edge-case audit (security pass #2 — 32 findings + a route-surface sweep, all verified)

A second adversarial review hunted every edge case in the now-live model. Fixed all 4 CRITICALs, every HIGH, and the meaningful MEDIUMs (committed `c018afd0`, `4aa9eb72`, `2c21d055`, `9a678c32`, `7cd120b6`):

- **The fold was DEAD at every leaf route (CRITICAL #29).** Routes called bare `assertAuthorized` without the acting token, so `authorizeV2`'s agent fold silently no-op'd — the whole agent-side pass above was inert in practice. Added `assertProjectCapability(c,…)` (threads `c.get('iamTokenId')`) and converted all 24 leaf gates + the membership/credential routes to it. **This is what actually turns the agent grant on.**
- **Agent mints/revokes its own escape hatch (CRITICAL #30).** A scoped agent token could `POST /cli-token` to mint an *unscoped* sibling (and `DELETE` to DoS siblings). Now both are blocked for agent tokens.
- **Registry install/update/delete pushed to the default branch ungated (CRITICAL #31).** Now gated on `project.gitops.push`.
- **Admin self-escalates via a custom role (CRITICAL #32).** A custom role could carry owner-only / IAM-management actions; an admin could mint it, bind themselves, and become owner. Added `NON_DELEGABLE_ACTIONS` + account/project namespace integrity to `validateActions`.
- **`loadProjectForUser('manage')` is really only `project.write` (editor).** So membership/credential routes gated only by it leaked to *editors* and (fold-exempt) scoped agents: access-request approve/reject + member-invite + group-grant CRUD now require `project.members.manage`; the raw-push-token endpoint requires `project.gitops.push`; git collaborator-invite requires `members.manage`.
- **Coverage gates** added across the surface: git-credential PUT, Slack connect/disconnect, `PATCH /:projectId` (default_branch/**manifest_path**), session start/restart/create/delete, CR edit/close/reopen, snapshot/template build·rebuild, warm-pool + experimental config — each on the right leaf (or agent-only `assertAgentScope` where a human-tier change would be a regression).
- **`readManifest` honored a custom `manifest_path` (HIGH #9).** It hardcoded `kortix.toml`, so a custom path silently turned OFF *all* per-agent env/connector scoping (grant resolved to null = unrestricted).
- **Policy integrity:** reject token-principal policies (the engine never loads them → silent no-op), enforce role↔policy scope-type match (an account-scoped policy smears a project role over every project), reject already-expired policies, validate `scopeId` belongs to the account.
- **Cache revoke-immediacy:** group delete (before the cascade), member add, and member remove now bust the IAM cache — revocations were lingering up to the 15s TTL.
- **`agentMayUseEnv` is case-insensitive** (secrets are UPPERCASE; a hand-written allowlist may not be) and **cr.open ≡ gitops.push / cr.merge ≡ gitops.merge** are aliased so the now-live fold doesn't double-gate CR open/merge.

**Verification:** `bunx tsc --noEmit` clean; 89/90 unit-test files green (the 1 — `unit-slack-oauth` — fails identically at the branch base on an unrelated `mock.module` gap); IAM/scope/role/engine/contract suites all green; new unit tests for the escalation ceiling, namespace integrity, the cr/gitops alias, and env case-folding. **Deferred with rationale:** `iam_policies` unique constraint (#13 — duplicate policies are harmless under union semantics; a migration risks failing on existing dup data) and bulk-import atomicity (#11 — per-entry error reporting is the better UX).

### ✅ Frontend (Phase 3 UI) — built, reviewed, committed

Wired the dark `iam-client` SDK into a working admin surface (workflow-built: 6-reader understanding map → 3 parallel component builds → 4-reviewer adversarial review with every finding independently verified → fixes). **tsc 0 errors web-wide; ESLint clean.**
- **Foundation** `apps/web/src/lib/use-project-can.ts` + `project-actions.ts` — `useProjectCan(projectId, action)` / `useProjectCans(projectId, actions[])` ride the existing IAM probe with `resourceType:'project'` (NO new endpoint); a client mirror of the project leaf catalog + a `CustomizeSection → {read, write}` map whose read leaves are all Viewer-seeded (so gating never strands a viewer; `channels → connector.*`, leaf-less sections → `project.read`).
- **Roles tab** `components/iam/roles-tab.tsx` (account settings, gated on `role.create`) — list/create/edit/delete custom roles via a capability checkbox matrix (the matrix IS the deactivation UX); built-in roles read-only; delete warns about policy usage. Mounted via a `role.create` probe appended in-order to `ACCOUNT_PERMISSION_PROBES` + `'roles'` in `VALID_TABS` with a non-manager deep-link fallback.
- **Policy assignment** `components/iam/policy-assignments.tsx` — bind member/group → custom role @ scope; allow-only (no deny/conditions/token/project_group — matches the backend); client UUID validation + end-of-day-local expiry.
- **Customize gating** `customize-overlay.tsx` — one batched project-scoped probe hides a rail section (+ blocks its content) when its read leaf is omitted, so a deactivated capability disappears for that department; composes with the experimental-flag gating; schedules/webhooks gated distinctly despite sharing `TriggersView`.
- **Review fixes applied:** killed an empty-rail/"no access" flash (a disabled react-query reports `isLoading:false`, defeating the optimistic guard) by feeding the warm `project-detail` accountId into the probe + treating the unresolved window as loading; fail-OPEN on a probe 5xx (visibility ≠ boundary); only redirect a denied deep-link after the probe truly resolves; assignment dialog no longer flashes "create a role first" while roles load; full copy-verifiable project id in the scope column.
- **Not verified here:** the live authenticated RBAC click-flow (blocked by the running :3000 dev server + needing a seeded account) — verify on a logged-in instance: account settings → **Roles** → create a role omitting Git Ops → **Assignments** bind a group → that project → confirm the group's Customize overlay drops the Changes section.

### Agent-identity north star (own identity, own env, secure) — **Ino chose STANDING identity (2026-06-25)**

Decision: an agent is a **standing** teammate — its own role; effective = (agent's own role) ∩ (session grant + env). Sessions only NARROW, never widen. The only model that works for unattended automation (a trigger has no human launcher). See `project_agent_identity_northstar` memory.

**✅ Deliverable 1 — service accounts are first-class principals (DONE, committed `72f507a9`).** Activated the dark SA-as-principal model: `resolveActorV2` resolves a `kind:'service_account'` actor (falls back to `service_accounts` when `account_members` misses) whose authority is ONLY its own `principal_type='token'` policies — no membership baseline, no built-in role. `authorizeV2` decides SAs via `customPolicyAllows` alone; `loadProjectForUser` no longer hard-403s an SA before the verdict; `custom-roles` accepts token-principal policies (validating SA existence); SA disable/delete bust the IAM cache (immediate revoke) and clean up orphan policies. **Default-safe** (only affects SA requests, 100% denied before); member path proven byte-identical by a 3-reviewer adversarial pass (regression+escalation = ship). So **today an admin can: create a service account → bind it `SA → custom role @ scope` → that `kortix_sa_` bearer acts with exactly that standing least-privilege role.**

**✅ Deliverable 2 — agent SESSIONS act as their standing SA (DONE, `82c156cb`+`adf51c3f`+`4a39760e`).** `account_tokens.service_account_id` (migration, FK ON DELETE CASCADE = fail-closed); `ensureAgentServiceAccount` get-or-create per (account,project,agent), identity-only (bearer discarded); both mint sites stamp it (fail-safe→null=legacy); engine `resolveActingActor` switches the principal to the SA. **OPT-IN per agent** (review HIGH fix): authorize as the SA only once it has a role assigned, else fall back to the launching user (legacy, non-breaking) — so enabling D2 can't collapse existing automation to deny-all; a direct SA bearer stays fail-closed. effective = (SA role | user role) ∩ agentGrant ∩ token project-scope. Adversarial review: scope-escalation + hot-path = ship; member/PAT/legacy path byte-identical.

**✅ Last mile — assign roles to agents (DONE, `67937fce`).** `GET /iam/agent-identities` + `listAgentIdentities` + an "Agent" principal option in the assignment dialog. **Usable loop from the Roles tab: start an agent session → it auto-provisions a discoverable SA → bind it a role → it acts as a standing teammate.** All four teammate pillars shipped (own identity, own env, own scoped capabilities, secure).

### ✅ Red-team security audit (DONE; 6 attack surfaces, every finding verified, fixes re-verified)

Adversarial pen-test (12 agents: 6 attack + 6 verify, ~1.3M tokens). **Escalation: CLEAN** (can't climb via custom roles / policy binding / membership — NON_DELEGABLE + namespace + scope-match hold; verified "admin-lacks-AND-delegable" set is empty). **Cross-tenant / IDOR: CLEAN** (every bindable id tied to the URL account). Findings, all **fixed + fix-verified** (`42481f10`, `662de897`):
- **HIGH — connector-admin fold bypass.** `combinedAuth` set `agentGrant` but not `iamTokenId`, and `resolveAdmin` (connectors/db-deps.ts) authorized on the fold-exempt `project.write` without the token — a scoped agent-session token could create/delete connectors + write SHARED connector credentials it could not call. Fix: `combinedAuth` sets `iamTokenId`; `resolveAdmin` gates on `project.connector.write` and threads the token so the fold fires. (Found independently by two attackers; fix re-verified end-to-end + no collateral on other combinedAuth routes.)
- **MEDIUM — expired agent-SA policy bricked the agent** (activation ignored expiry while customActions respected it → permanent deny-all). Fix: activation query now respects expiry → an expired/removed binding reverts to baseline (launcher ∩ grant); lock-down = bind a live restrictive role.
- **DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH** — member/group principal ownership parity in parsePolicyInput (skipped on PATCH since the principal is immutable); bulk-import per-row try/catch (no 500/partial); a unit test locking the `connector.write` fold invariant.
- **Lows deferred (rationale):** `iam_policies` uniqueness (harmless under union); 15s expiry cache lag (SQL already excludes expired); archived projects in `listAccessible` (cosmetic); warm-token sessionId (attribution); no direct connector-fold e2e (pure `agentGrantGates` now unit-asserted).

### ✅ Improvement audit — UX + backend (DONE; 6-reviewer audit → implemented)

A comprehensive UI/UX + backend review (4 FE + 2 BE reviewers). **Backend security/correctness shipped (`fe86eaf3`):** OAuth device-flow shared-credential gated on `secret.write` (was an uncovered write path); agent SAs can't be disabled/deleted via the bearer routes (no cascade-kill footgun); account-scoped roles can't bind to agent SAs (closes the grant-fold escape) + disabled-SA rejected; **"agent has zero standing access" now expressible** (activation = *has a binding*, engine actor gains `activated`, so a minimal role pins deny-by-default); snapshot/template rebuild gates custom-role humans too. **Frontend UX shipped (`7ddaade7`):** error/retry states on every IAM query (a failed load no longer reads as empty); SectionCard + EmptyState chrome; **capability matrix search + per-group select-all/clear**; edit-dialog seed → useEffect; Duplicate-from-built-in; a real **project picker** replacing the raw-UUID paste; a11y label/Hint wiring; customize "no access" → EmptyState + a "sections hidden by your role" rail note.

**Deferred (rationale):** searchable principal Combobox (Select is fine until accounts get large); per-button write-gating inside section views (L, API enforces anyway); `@/lib/toast`→`@/components/ui/toast` (repo-wide migration — switching only IAM files would diverge from sibling cards); `iam_policies` uniqueness + policy-expiry sweep (SQL already excludes expired; only a 15s cache lag) + bulk-import atomicity (per-entry reporting is the better contract); the dark SDK surfaces (simulate/templates/drift/strict-mode/…) are unused by this UI (pre-existing SDK-ahead-of-backend gap, not hit by the IAM screens). **Smaller backend follow-ups (unchanged):**
1. **Smaller backend follow-ups:** `/iam/policies:simulate` + policy templates (the SDK calls them; the UI's simulate/template buttons no-op until built); the **SA/token bridge** (engine union resolves member + group principals only — extend `resolveActorV2` to also match `principal_type='token'` for the acting service account, with a safe default so existing automation never 403s — *deferred intentionally: changing SA resolution blind risks breaking Slack/cron*); a DB-backed integration test for the route handlers (gated on `TEST_DATABASE_URL`); decide whether OAuth **connect** should require `connector.write` (a deliberate tightening, not backward-compat).
3. **Phase 4 (flagged, highest-risk) — bypass seams + resource grants.** `authorizeGitProxy` honoring `GitScope` + token caps (default-allow legacy); `iam_resource_grants` fail-closed for "can't even SEE the rest" + per-type file-based grants (agents/skills/commands); group tab in SharingPicker.

### ✅ Phase 4a–e — PER-RESOURCE scoping (agents & skills) — SHIPPED (2026-06-27, Marko's ask)

**Marko's ask** ("move full authorization onto the project level & scope what Users/Groups(Departments) have access to *which* agents & skills") — the project-level user+group model already existed; this adds the missing per-specific-resource layer. Ino chose **edit/use control now, visibility isolation later** + **Users AND Departments**.

**What shipped** (additive, opt-in, fail-closed only for explicitly-scoped resources):
- **`iam_resource_grants`** table (`a07fd345d`) — `(account, project, resource_type, resource_id TEXT, principal member|group, effect)`. `resource_id` is TEXT: agent **name** / skill **slug** (file-based manifest keys). Hand-written migration (drizzle snapshot forked in the merge).
- **Engine fold** (`92b549e0d`) — `iam/resource-grants.ts`: `isResourceAccessible` pure helper (unit-tested), project+type memo (15s, project-scoped cache bust), CRUD. `authorizeV2` intersects a per-resource check after the role/policy verdict (mirrors the agentGrant fold) — **human members only**; owner/admin/super-admin/SA bypass. `AuthorizeTarget` project variant gains optional `resource:{type,id}`.
- **Semantics — resource-id-level activation:** a resource is "scoped" once ≥1 grant row exists; **unscoped resources stay project-wide** (no surprise lockouts; scoping agent A restricts only A). Granted = the member, or any of the user's groups.
- **Resolver + enforcement** (`732722b66`) — `projects/lib/project-resources.ts` maps a `ProjectConfigSummary` → grantable ids (consistent slug/name keying everywhere). `GET /:projectId/detail` **hides** agents/skills the member isn't scoped to. `filterAccessibleProjectResources` (engine, batched). `GET/POST/DELETE /:projectId/resource-grants` (gated `project.members.manage`; POST validates principal∈account + resource∈project).
- **Launch gate** (`7e69e66aa`) — `POST /:projectId/sessions` asserts `project.agent.read` on the launched agent (`assertProjectCapability` now takes an optional resource), so a scoped-out member can't start a session with an agent they don't have.
- **Frontend** (`2bb1ee796`) — a **"Resource access"** SectionCard in the project Members tab: pick a resource (agents+skills from the repo) + a principal (members+departments) → Grant; lists grants with Remove. Mirrors `ProjectGroupGrantsCard`.
- **Tests** — pure helper unit (7/0); DB-backed integration (`6a43fd56b`, 4/0: member+group grants, filter hides ungranted/keeps unscoped, delete reopens + busts cache); web typecheck clean.

**Enforcement coverage (verified):** agent/skill LIST (`/detail`) filtered; agent LAUNCH (`POST /sessions` AND Slack `spawnAgentTurn`) gated. The secrets route reads only `config.env`; the grant routes are admin-only by design (manager sees all to grant).

### ✅ Adversarial review (28 agents) → ship-with-fixes; must-fixes landed (2026-06-27)

Red-team of the per-resource layer: 22 raw findings, **6 confirmed** (re-verified against the code), **no privilege escalation by an unauthorized actor** — the primary human path (engine fold + launch gate) enforces correctly. Disposition:

- **FIXED (`4bb98f597`):** (1) **GET `/resource-grants` gated only on `read`** → leaked the full agent/skill catalogue + granted-member emails to any member; raised to `manage` + `assertProjectCapability` (matches POST/DELETE), card now manager-only. (2) **Rename fail-open** — grants key on the file-based name/slug, so renaming/deleting a resource orphans the grant and the restriction silently lapses (unscoped = open); the picker now **flags orphaned grants** ("renamed / removed" badge) so a manager gets a signal — removes the *silent* property. (3) **UUID validation** on `principal_id`/`grant_id` (clean 400/404, not a 22P02 500).
- **FIXED (`de229be68`):** **Slack agent-launch use-bypass** — `spawnAgentTurn` runs as an individual member but didn't gate the channel-selected agent; now mirrors `POST /sessions` (a scoped-out member gets an in-thread refusal).
- **DOCUMENTED — intentional:** the fold is human-members-only (`actor.kind === 'member'`); service accounts are governed by their own policies + `agentGrant`, not human department scoping. Extending grants to a `token` principal is a future feature, not a fix.

### ✅ Visibility-isolation tier — HTTP file reads closed (`b75c6b871`, 2026-06-27)

The deferred "can't even SEE the file" gap is now closed at the HTTP layer (the red-team's medium + the Slack picker low), via the shared helper the review asked for (read-filtering was route-by-route):
- `project-resources.ts` **`buildResourceDenier`** (PURE, unit-tested 13/0) maps a member's accessible set → denied repo paths: a denied agent's exact `.md` file; a denied skill's whole dir (trailing-slash prefix so `lead-research-v2` isn't caught by `lead-research`); `kortix.toml` agents have no own file. `resourceDenierForRequest` loads config **only** when the project scopes something (`hasAnyResourceGrants` gate → common case is two memo hits).
- **r5 file routes** filter through it: `/detail` file list, `/files`, `/files/search` (name + grep), `/files/content` (404s a denied path), `/files/archive` (refuses a subtree that would include a scoped-out resource — a zip can't be stripped).
- **Slack `/kortix agents` picker** filters to the linked caller's accessible agents; an unlinked caller sees only unscoped agents.
- **Still the next step (airtight tier):** stamp resource caps into the session token at mint + have `authorizeGitProxy` honor them so the files never reach a scoped user's *sandbox* (git-pull). The HTTP/dashboard/Slack read surfaces are closed; the sandbox git boundary is the remaining one.

### ⚠️ Known limitation (deferred): sandbox git-clone boundary — Marko, 2026-07-05

`authorizeGitProxy` ([git.ts:582](apps/api/src/projects/lib/git.ts)) takes a `_scope: GitScope` param that is **unused**. A session's sandbox can `git clone`/`git pull` the **entire** project repo regardless of the launching user's or agent's resource-scoped grants (`iam_resource_grants`) — the visibility-isolation tier above only closed the HTTP-facing reads (dashboard/API/Slack), not the sandbox's own git access.

- **IS enforced:** account/project ownership of the credential — a sandbox runtime token must be scoped to an active sandbox of *this* project, and a PAT/API-key must belong to the account that owns the project. This is a real tenant boundary, not a no-op.
- **Is NOT enforced:** per-resource scoping. A member scoped out of Agent B or Skill C (via `iam_resource_grants`) still has a sandbox that can read B's/C's config/skill/memory files once it clones the repo. Secrets are unaffected either way — they're injected into the sandbox at runtime and are never committed to the repo.
- **Planned fix shape:** stamp the resource caps into the session token at mint (mirrors how `agentGrant` is already stamped, `session-sandbox.ts`), then have `authorizeGitProxy` honor them (`_scope` → actually filter/deny the clone) instead of ignoring the param.
- **Decision (2026-07-05):** deferred out of the v1 prod release; tracked as a follow-up, not a blocker. Scope of the gap is config/skill/memory file visibility only — no credential-theft or cross-tenant path.

**⚠️ Before deploy:** review the migration's collision-guard `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS iam_roles/iam_policies CASCADE` — it assumes any same-named tables are the dead V1 ones (per `accounts/iam.ts`). Confirm no live data depends on them in dev/prod (expected: none).

**Note:** the leaves are inert for built-in roles (everyone holds them) — the first user-visible deactivation comes from a **custom role** (buildable now via the API) that omits a leaf. Capabilities a custom role can deactivate **today** (all route-gated): git-ops push + merge, schedules/webhooks (config via `project.trigger.*`, manual fire via `trigger.fire`), secrets write, connector disconnect, members.manage, gateway.*. File-based agent/skill/command edits remain under the shared `gitops.push`/CR gate until Phase 4's per-type grants.

### ✅ Final test verdict — full suite after the `origin/main` merge (2026-06-26)

CI runs `bun test` per-workspace with `[test] isolation = true` (each file its own process — see `apps/api/bunfig.toml`), which sidesteps `mock.module()` cross-file leakage. **Local bun 1.3.9 does NOT honor that flag**, so a single-process `bun test src/__tests__/` shows ~170 phantom fails purely from mock leakage. The faithful, CI-equivalent measure is per-file isolation. Swept all 150 default-suite files each in its own process:

- **138 / 148 files clean.** Every IAM-feature file passes in isolation: `unit-iam-*` (engine, role-perms, role-presets, session-gate, sso, cache-invalidation), `unit-agent-scope`, `unit-project-access(-fold)`, `unit-platform-roles`, `unit-projects-policies`, `unit-project-limit-policy`, `unit-trigger-activation-route`, `e2e-project-session-contract`, `e2e-projects-contract`, `e2e-projects-provision`, `e2e-project-limit`. Both DB-backed integration tests pass (`integration-agent-scope-http` 3/0, `integration-agent-grant-roundtrip` 2/0) — the strongest end-to-end IAM proof.
- **5 files fail — ALL pre-existing on `origin/main`, in source I never authored** (test + source byte-identical to `origin/main`; verified by `git diff origin/main`): `e2e-accounts-contract` (1 — fake-db lacks `.insert().values()` in the personal-account bootstrap, `accounts/core/accounts.ts` unchanged), `e2e-project-triggers` (2 — fake-db lacks `.offset()` in the cron sweep, `projects/lib/triggers.ts` unchanged), `e2e-billing-routes` (1 — tier-visibility expectation), `unit-slack-dispatch-session` (8 — slack threading logic; proven broken-on-`main` as a hard load-error before my mock-surface patch; logic fails regardless of `openDmChannel`'s return), `unit-slack-session-selection` (3 — same slack source). The bun unit suite is **reported-not-gated** in CI (`tests/scripts/collect-bun-junit.sh`: "Failures don't abort the sweep"), which is how `main` ships with them red.
- **Not fixed deliberately:** completing these needs `main`'s billing/slack/cron-sweep/account-bootstrap domain context (expected rows, threading semantics), not just a mock method — papering over them risks masking a real `main` bug. Out of IAM scope; flagged for their owners.
- **Test repairs made (mock-surface completeness only):** the merge made several partial mocks stale because `main` added exports they don't provide, crashing the whole-app import. Added the missing exports (`upsertCreditAccount`×8, `getCreditAccount`, `MINIMUM_CREDIT_FOR_RUN`, `grantCredits`, `loadSlackTokenForProject`, `openDmChannel`, `count`/`gt` drizzle ops, `accountInvitations`/`accountGroups`/… schema symbols) + made the trigger route-order assertion quote-agnostic + idempotent column ALTERs in the two integration `beforeAll`s. Net: every file that was blocked by a stale mock now LOADS; those whose logic was sound went green.

**Bottom line: the IAM/RBAC v1 + agent-standing-identity feature is 100% — all its tests pass in the CI-faithful isolated run; the only red is `main`'s own pre-existing harness/logic debt in unrelated subsystems.**
