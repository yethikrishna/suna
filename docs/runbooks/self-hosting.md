# Runbook: Self-hosting Kortix

**Kortix self-host is VPS-first.** The supported way to run it is on your own
VPS or server with a persistent domain pointed at it — that combination is
what makes reachability, TLS, and agent sessions work correctly and durably.
Running it on a local machine with no public domain is a convenience for
evaluating the product, not a deployment target: it needs a Cloudflare
tunnel to get any external reachability at all, that URL is ephemeral by
default, and browsers enforce connection limits against plain-HTTP
`localhost` that a real deployment won't hit. If you're deciding where to run
this for real, provision a VPS and point a domain at it.

Kortix self-host is **one generic Docker-native system**: `kortix self-host`
generates a `docker-compose.yml` + `.env` (+ a `Caddyfile` and `updater.sh` when
a domain is configured) into `~/.config/kortix/self-host/<instance>/` and runs
`docker compose up`. The same artifact happens to also run on a local
machine, any VPS, or a cloud VM (EC2, Droplet, etc.) — there is no separate "target" to
pick, no AWS profile, no Terraform, no TUF/signing, no SSM. A public domain is
just an env var (`KORTIX_DOMAIN`) the same stack reacts to, not a different
deployment mechanism.

The stack: Caddy (reverse proxy + ACME TLS, only present when a domain is
configured) → `kortix-api`, `llm-gateway`, `frontend`, plus the official
Supabase Docker distribution (Kong, Postgres, Auth, Storage, Realtime, etc.),
plus an in-compose `kortix-updater` service that keeps the stack converged to
the configured image channel. Agent sessions still run on Daytona (or another
configured sandbox provider) — sandboxes are managed compute, not part of this
box.

## Prerequisites

- **A VPS or server you control (recommended), or a local machine for
  evaluation only** — Linux (any VPS, EC2, bare metal) or macOS/Linux with
  Docker Desktop or Docker Engine.
- Docker Engine + the Compose plugin (`docker compose version`). The bootstrap
  script below installs these for you on a fresh Linux box.
- **Required for production:** a domain you control, with its DNS A/AAAA
  record (and the API subdomain's) pointed at the box's public IP. This is
  what turns on a public HTTPS URL instead of loopback-only ports, and it's
  the reachability mode agent sandboxes need to work reliably. Ports **80**
  and **443** must be reachable from the internet for ACME HTTP-01 once a
  domain is set.
- **Required for agent sessions to actually run:** a sandbox provider and
  managed-git access (a GitHub PAT or GitHub App) so the platform can create
  project repos. Recommended, standard choices: [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/)
  (the default) or [Platinum](https://www.platinum.dev/), Kortix's own microVM
  sandbox provider. [E2B](https://e2b.dev/) is also supported. Any of these
  need an API key, settable after first boot with `kortix self-host configure`.
- **Not required to get started:** email. A fresh install auto-confirms email
  signups and leads with password auth, so the first account works with zero
  email configuration. Set `EMAIL_URL` later to turn on invite email and
  magic-link sign-in — one variable, see below.

## Reachability (required for agent sessions) — VPS-first

Agent sessions run inside a **cloud** sandbox VM — outside your network —
that calls back to this instance's API over the public internet via
`KORTIX_URL`. That means `KORTIX_URL` can never be a loopback/internal
address: a sandbox trying to reach `http://localhost:...` or an internal
Docker hostname like `http://kortix-api:8008` will simply never connect, and
agent sessions fail with a fast, explicit error (or, before this URL was
validated, a confusing hang). Note the failure is specifically in that
**callback** — a cloud sandbox itself is perfectly reachable compute; it's
`KORTIX_URL` (this API, reachable from the sandbox) that has to be real.

`kortix self-host init`/`configure` ask interactively how this instance is
reachable from the internet, and only ever offer two choices (defaulting to
the domain path); non-interactively, pick one of:

1. **`--domain kortix.example.com`** — you have a public domain pointed at
   this machine. **The recommended, production path**: turns on the bundled
   Caddy reverse proxy + ACME TLS, and `KORTIX_URL` becomes
   `https://api.<domain>`. This is the only choice with a stable URL and no
   browser caveats — deploy on a VPS with a domain for anything beyond
   kicking the tyres.
2. **`--tunnel cloudflare`** — no public domain. A `cloudflared` Compose
   service exposes the API to the internet with zero DNS/firewall setup, and
   the CLI wires `KORTIX_URL` to the tunnel's public URL automatically. **For
   local machines / evaluation — not recommended for production.** By
   default that URL is **ephemeral** (a fresh one on every restart) and
   browsers enforce connection limits against plain-HTTP `localhost` that a
   real deployment won't hit. See below.

There is no third "local-only" mode to deliberately choose: if you're on a
local machine with no public domain, use the tunnel. Passing neither flag
non-interactively just leaves the instance in an unconfigured fallback state
— `init`/`start` print a loud warning every time that's the case, because
agent sessions genuinely cannot run until one of the two is set.

Switch reachability any time with `kortix self-host configure` (interactive)
or the same flags on `init`/`update`. Re-running with neither flag never
resets an already-configured choice.

### Cloudflare tunnel mechanics (no public domain, evaluation only)

`--tunnel cloudflare` adds a `cloudflared` service to the Compose stack that
tunnels straight to `kortix-api` (Caddy is never present in this mode — there
is no domain). By default this is a **zero-config quick tunnel**
(`cloudflared tunnel --url ...`, no Cloudflare account needed): a fresh
`https://<random>.trycloudflare.com` URL is minted every time the
`cloudflared` container starts.

Because that URL is **ephemeral**, `kortix self-host start`/`update` always:

1. Bring the stack (including `cloudflared`) up.
2. Poll the `cloudflared` container's logs for the URL it just printed
   (up to 30s).
3. Write it into `.env` as `KORTIX_URL` and recreate `kortix-api` so the new
   value actually takes effect.

If `cloudflared` was already running (a plain re-`start` with nothing
stopped), it keeps its existing tunnel/URL and this is a no-op. A full
`stop`/`start` (or `down`/`start`) always gets a **new** URL — that's expected
and handled automatically; there is nothing to reconcile by hand.

For a **stable** URL instead — recommended once you're past kicking the
tyres — create a named tunnel in the
[Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), bind a
hostname to it, and set:

```sh
kortix self-host env set CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=... CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_HOSTNAME=kortix-tunnel.example.com
kortix self-host start
```

With both set, `cloudflared` authenticates to that specific tunnel
(`cloudflared tunnel run --token ...`) instead of opening a quick tunnel, and
`KORTIX_URL` is derived directly from the hostname — no log-scraping, and it
never changes across restarts.

## Quickstart

**VPS-first: provision a VPS → point DNS at it → `init --domain` → `start`.**
The no-public-domain/tunnel path further down is for evaluating the product
only — not for production use.

### VPS / EC2 / any bare Linux box (recommended)

1. **Provision a VPS or server** (any provider — a small box is enough to
   start: 2 vCPU / 4GB RAM is a reasonable floor).
2. **Point DNS at it** — create an A/AAAA record for your domain (and the API
   subdomain, `api.<domain>` by default) pointing at the box's public IP.
   Ports **80** and **443** must be reachable from the internet for ACME
   HTTP-01 once you set the domain.
3. **Run the bootstrap script**, which installs Docker, installs the `kortix`
   CLI, runs `kortix self-host init --domain <your-domain>`, and starts the
   stack:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kortix-ai/suna/main/scripts/kortix-selfhost-up.sh \
  | bash -s -- --domain kortix.example.com --email ops@example.com
```

or, if you already cloned the repo:

```sh
bash scripts/kortix-selfhost-up.sh --domain kortix.example.com --email ops@example.com
```

This installs Docker if missing, installs the `kortix` CLI, runs
`kortix self-host init`, points the stack at your domain (turning on the
bundled Caddy reverse proxy with ACME HTTP-01 TLS on 80/443), and runs
`kortix self-host start`. See `scripts/kortix-selfhost-up.sh --help` for every
flag (channel, auto-update policy, instance name, Daytona key). Re-running the
script is safe — every step it drives (`init`, `env set`, `start`) is
idempotent.

Or drive it directly with the CLI, without the bootstrap script (e.g. Docker
is already installed):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://kortix.com/install | bash
kortix self-host init --domain kortix.example.com
kortix self-host start
```

After first boot, configure the sandbox provider and managed git:

```sh
kortix self-host configure       # interactive wizard: Daytona key, GitHub, Pipedream
# or non-interactively:
kortix self-host env set DAYTONA_API_KEY=... MANAGED_GIT_GITHUB_TOKEN=... MANAGED_GIT_GITHUB_OWNER=...
kortix self-host start           # re-applies env + restarts affected services
```

### Provisioning a VPS with Terraform (optional)

If you'd rather provision the box declaratively than run a script by hand,
`infra/terraform/modules/selfhost-ec2` is a **thin, optional convenience
provisioner** — it is not a different deployment system. Terraform creates the
EC2 instance, a separate encrypted EBS data volume, a security group (80/443),
an Elastic IP, optional Route53 records, and a configurable-schedule snapshot
policy for the data volume (`backup_interval_hours` / `backup_retention_count`
— every 24h/7 kept by default, but e.g. every 6h/10 kept works too), then
cloud-init runs the *exact same* `kortix self-host init` /
`kortix self-host start` described above. After `apply` finishes, the
in-compose auto-updater — not Terraform — is what keeps the app current;
re-running `terraform apply` never redeploys it. Secrets (the Daytona key,
managed git, SMTP, ...) are deliberately not Terraform inputs; the module's
`post_apply_next_steps` output tells you how to set them (SSM in, `kortix
self-host configure`, or the dashboard) once the box is up.

```hcl
module "kortix_selfhost" {
  source = "github.com/kortix-ai/suna//infra/terraform/modules/selfhost-ec2"

  domain = "kortix.example.com"
  tags   = { Project = "kortix-selfhost" }
}
```

See `infra/terraform/examples/selfhost-ec2` for a runnable root module and
`infra/terraform/modules/selfhost-ec2/README.md` for the full variable/output
reference — including why the data volume is mounted the way it is (Postgres
is a bind mount under the CLI's instance directory, not a Docker named volume,
so the module points `KORTIX_SELF_HOST_CONFIG_DIR` at the EBS volume rather
than just bind-mounting `/var/lib/docker`) and how an instance can be replaced
without losing data (daily EBS snapshots + `delete_on_termination = false`).

### Evaluating on a local machine, no public domain (not for production)

This path is for kicking the tyres on your own machine — it is **not**
recommended for real use. See Reachability above for the specific caveats
(ephemeral tunnel URL, browser connection limits on plain-HTTP `localhost`,
and no external reachability at all without the tunnel).

```sh
curl -fsSL https://kortix.com/install | bash
kortix self-host init --tunnel cloudflare
kortix self-host start
```

Supabase, the API, the gateway, and the frontend come up on loopback ports
(default dashboard: `http://localhost:13737`) — the bundled `cloudflared`
quick tunnel is what makes agent sessions work at all with no domain/DNS
(see Reachability above). `start` prints the exact URLs, the tunnel's public
URL, and warns if the sandbox provider or managed git aren't configured yet.
Omitting `--tunnel cloudflare` leaves reachability unconfigured — no agent
sessions, and `init`/`start` warn loudly every time (see Reachability above).
When you're ready for real use, switch to a VPS with a domain (see above) —
`kortix self-host configure` or `init --domain <domain>` any time, on the
same box or a new one.

## The `kortix self-host` command surface

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `kortix self-host init` | Create or refresh this instance's Compose + `.env`. Non-mutating to a running stack. |
| `kortix self-host configure` | Interactive wizard for integrations (Daytona, GitHub, Pipedream) and update policy. |
| `kortix self-host start` | Pull images and start (or re-converge) the stack. Creates config first if needed. |
| `kortix self-host update` / `reconcile` | Pull the configured channel's newest images now, migrate, and roll the stack forward. Exactly what the in-compose auto-updater does on its own schedule, run once immediately. |
| `kortix self-host rollback --release <v>` | Roll back to an explicit older version (same mechanics as `update`, pinned). |
| `kortix self-host version` | Show the running version, the configured channel, and whether a newer release is available. |
| `kortix self-host stop` / `restart` | Stop / restart the stack. |
| `kortix self-host status` | Container status (`docker compose ps`). |
| `kortix self-host doctor` | Validate Docker tooling and the rendered Compose config. Non-mutating. |
| `kortix self-host logs [service]` | Tail Compose logs. |
| `kortix self-host open` | Open the dashboard in a browser. |
| `kortix self-host env ls [--show]` | Show every persistent value, grouped by service; secrets masked by default (`--show` reveals). |
| `kortix self-host env set KEY=VALUE …` | Set any value (secret or plain config) and restart exactly the services it affects. |
| `kortix self-host env rotate KEY \| --all-generated` | Regenerate a rotatable CLI-generated secret (JWT signing key, internal tokens, ...) in place. |
| `kortix self-host uninstall` | Stop the stack and permanently delete this instance's containers, volumes, and config. Interactive confirmation (type the instance name); `--yes` for scripts. |

Common flags: `--instance <name>` (default `default` — run multiple isolated
stacks on one box), `--tag <version>` / `--release <version>` (pin an explicit
image tag), `--channel stable|latest`, `--auto-update on|off`,
`--update-interval <seconds>`, `--domain <domain>` / `--tunnel cloudflare`
(reachability — see above), `--json`, `--yes`.

Full reference: [`/docs/reference/cli#self-host`](../../apps/web/content/docs/reference/cli.mdx).

## Using the main `kortix` CLI against your self-host

`kortix self-host …` only manages the Compose stack itself. Everything else —
`login`, `whoami`, `projects`, `ship`, `sessions`, … — is the same CLI you'd
point at Kortix Cloud, just aimed at your own instance via the built-in
`selfhost` host:

```sh
kortix hosts use selfhost   # switch the CLI's active host to your self-host stack
kortix login                # browser-based approval, same flow as Cloud
kortix whoami                # confirm identity + active account/project
kortix projects ls
cd your-project && kortix ship   # first ship creates the project + repo; every ship after just syncs
```

`kortix self-host init`/`start` register the `selfhost` host for you —
pointed at `API_PUBLIC_URL` (the API) with `PUBLIC_URL` (the dashboard)
stamped alongside it as `dashboard_url`, so `kortix login`'s browser flow
opens the right origin. That matters because the CLI has no other way to
learn your dashboard's URL from the API URL alone: it normally *derives* one
from the API URL's shape (`api.<domain>` → `<domain>`, or the `pnpm dev`
pairing `:8008` → `:3000`), which is right for a domain deployment
(`https://api.<domain>` → `https://<domain>`) but **wrong** for the
local-machine default (API `:13738`, dashboard `:13737` — not `:3000`) or any
custom port.
If you ever add the host by hand instead of through `kortix self-host`
(pointing the CLI at a self-host instance from a *different* machine, for
example) and `kortix login` opens a dead-looking `:3000`, pass the dashboard
URL explicitly:

```sh
kortix hosts add selfhost --url http://localhost:13738 --dashboard-url http://localhost:13737   # local machine
kortix hosts add selfhost --url https://api.kortix.example.com --dashboard-url https://kortix.example.com   # domain
```

**`kortix ship`** needs a git backend to push to — either an existing GitHub
remote (via the GitHub App or `--github-token`, both set up in the dashboard
under **Settings → Git**, see step 4 of the quickstart) or no origin at all
(ship then creates a managed Kortix-hosted repo, no GitHub needed). If
managed git isn't configured yet, `ship -n` (dry-run) still validates
`kortix.yaml`, resolves the target project, and shows the push plan without
needing it.

## The auto-updater + channels

Every instance always has a `kortix-updater` service in its Compose file (an
`image: docker:cli` container with the Docker socket mounted). On an interval
(default: daily — `KORTIX_UPDATE_INTERVAL`, 86400s) it:

1. Pulls this stack's configured image tags.
2. Fingerprints the resulting image IDs. If nothing changed, it no-ops.
3. If something changed, runs the `kortix-migrate` one-shot to apply any new
   database migrations, then rolls the stack forward (`docker compose up -d --wait`).
4. Writes a breadcrumb (`deployed-version.json`) recording what it applied.

A `flock` around each cycle means an overlapping run always skips rather than
racing a previous one. `KORTIX_AUTO_UPDATE=false` makes every cycle a no-op
without removing the service.

Two channels, both moving Docker tags on `kortix/kortix-api`,
`kortix/kortix-frontend`, and `kortix/kortix-gateway`:

- **`stable`** (default) — recommended for production use.
- **`latest`** — bleeding-edge, tracks the newest published build.

Change channel or policy any time:

```sh
kortix self-host configure                              # interactive
kortix self-host env set KORTIX_CHANNEL=latest           # or: kortix self-host update --channel latest
kortix self-host env set KORTIX_AUTO_UPDATE=false
kortix self-host env set KORTIX_UPDATE_INTERVAL=3600
```

Or pin an exact version instead of tracking a moving tag:

```sh
kortix self-host update --tag 0.9.84
```

`kortix self-host version` shows what's actually running (resolving a moving
tag to the concrete version it currently points to, via Docker Hub) and
whether a newer release is available.

> **Release-flow contract this depends on:** the self-host default channel is
> `stable`. A prod release (`deploy-prod.yml` → GitHub Release) retags
> `:latest` and the exact `:X.Y.Z` on all three app images (`kortix-api`,
> `kortix-frontend`, `kortix-gateway`) automatically. The moving `:stable`
> tag is promoted **separately and deliberately**, not on every release: a
> human runs the
> [`Promote Self-Host Stable`](https://github.com/kortix-ai/suna/actions/workflows/promote-self-host-stable.yml)
> workflow (`workflow_dispatch`, picks a version) to repoint `:stable` →
> that version's digest (`docker buildx imagetools create`) on all three
> images. Curation is intentional — we don't push every prod release to
> every self-hosted box overnight; only proven versions reach `:stable`.
> From the moment a version is promoted, self-host installs tracking the
> (default) `stable` channel pick it up on their next auto-updater cycle.
> To get a release that hasn't been promoted to `:stable` yet, use
> `--channel latest` or pin `--tag <version>`.

## Configuring email, Daytona, and other integrations later

Everything is `kortix self-host env set KEY=VALUE …` followed by
`kortix self-host start` (or the interactive `kortix self-host configure`),
whether at first boot or months later:

```sh
# Sandbox runtime (required for agent sessions)
kortix self-host env set DAYTONA_API_KEY=... DAYTONA_SERVER_URL=https://app.daytona.io/api DAYTONA_TARGET=us

# Managed git (required to create projects) — PAT or GitHub App
kortix self-host env set MANAGED_GIT_PROVIDER=github MANAGED_GIT_GITHUB_TOKEN=... MANAGED_GIT_GITHUB_OWNER=your-org

# Email (optional) — ONE connection string turns on BOTH invite/access-request
# email and auth email (magic link, signup confirmation, password reset).
kortix self-host env set EMAIL_URL=smtp://user:pass@smtp.example.com:587

# Pipedream connectors (optional)
kortix self-host env set CONNECTOR_AUTH_PROVIDER=pipedream PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID=... \
  PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=... PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID=...
```

`kortix self-host env ls` lists every key (secrets masked); `kortix self-host
doctor` validates the rendered Compose config without applying anything.

### Email: one variable

`EMAIL_URL` is the only email setting. The scheme picks the transport:

| `EMAIL_URL` | Transport |
| --- | --- |
| `smtp://user:pass@mail.example.com:587` | SMTP, STARTTLS |
| `smtps://user:pass@mail.example.com:465` | SMTP, implicit TLS |
| `resend://re_xxxxxxxx` | Resend HTTP API |
| `ses://AKIA...:secret@us-east-2` | AWS SES (static credentials) |
| `ses://us-east-2` | AWS SES (instance role) |
| `mailtrap://<api-token>` | Mailtrap HTTP API |

Comma-separate several for a fallback chain, tried left to right:

```sh
kortix self-host env set EMAIL_URL=ses://us-east-2,smtp://user:pass@backup.example.com:587
```

Setting it derives everything else, so there is nothing else to configure:

- **Product email** (invites, project access requests) sends through it.
- **Auth email** (magic link, signup confirmation, password reset, email
  change) sends through it too: GoTrue stops sending mail itself and posts each
  one to `kortix-api`'s send-email hook, which renders the Kortix template and
  sends it through the same provider. That is why `resend://` and `ses://` work
  for auth email even though GoTrue itself speaks only SMTP.
- `AUTH_EMAIL_HOOK_SECRET` is generated once and shared with GoTrue.
- `ENABLE_EMAIL_AUTOCONFIRM` flips to `false` and `KORTIX_PUBLIC_AUTH_METHODS`
  becomes `password,magic` — but only on the transition into "email
  configured". A later manual override of either is never overwritten.
- `EMAIL_FROM` defaults to `Kortix <noreply@<your-domain>>`. Override it with
  an address on a domain whose SPF/DKIM authorizes your relay:

```sh
kortix self-host env set EMAIL_FROM="Acme <no-reply@acme.com>"
```

Clearing `EMAIL_URL` reverses all of it, including restoring auto-confirmed
signups — an instance that cannot send mail must not require email
confirmation, or every new signup is stranded.

Two extra flags for awkward relays: `?tls=off` (relay offers no STARTTLS) and
`?insecure=1` (self-signed certificate). Credentials are never sent over an
unencrypted connection unless `?tls=off` is set explicitly.

`kortix self-host doctor` parses `EMAIL_URL` and reports the resolved provider
chain, so a typo surfaces there instead of as a missing invite.

## SAML SSO + SCIM (Enterprise)

GoTrue SAML is enabled on every self-host instance by default: `init`
generates a per-instance RSA SAML signing key (`SAML_PRIVATE_KEY`) the same
way it generates `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`/`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and
`GOTRUE_SAML_ENABLED=true` is wired straight through to the `supabase-auth`
service. That only turns on the *capability* — no IdP is registered and the
enterprise IAM surface (SSO/SCIM/RBAC/audit) stays hidden behind a 402 until
you unlock the entitlement:

```sh
kortix self-host env set ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_AVAILABLE=true
# or pass --enterprise-license to `init`/`configure`
kortix self-host start
```

With that flag on, register an IdP exactly like on Kortix Cloud — see
`docs/ENTRA_SSO_SCIM_SETUP.md` for the full walkthrough (Entra/Okta/Google/
custom SAML, group→role mapping, SCIM). Two paths:

- **Self-serve (recommended)**: sign in as an account owner/admin → Account →
  Settings → Identity → SAML SSO → Configure → Import IdP metadata. Kortix
  registers the IdP with your self-hosted Supabase Auth (`/auth/v1/admin/sso/
  providers`) server-side — you never touch Supabase directly. Everything
  (Entity ID, ACS URL, metadata endpoint) is derived from your own
  `KORTIX_DOMAIN`/tunnel URL, never a Kortix Cloud URL.
- **Advanced/operator path**: run `supabase sso add --type saml --metadata-url
  "<idp metadata url>" --domains your-company.com` yourself against your
  self-hosted Supabase project, then paste the returned provider UUID into the
  same dashboard dialog (`PUT /v1/accounts/{accountId}/iam/sso/provider`).

Verify the plumbing independent of any IdP with:

```sh
curl -s https://<your-domain>/auth/v1/settings -H "apikey: $(kortix self-host env ls --json --show | jq -r '.categories[] | select(.category=="database") | .secrets[] | select(.key=="SUPABASE_ANON_KEY") | .value')" | jq .saml_enabled
# → true
```

Notes:
- **Never rotate `SAML_PRIVATE_KEY`** once an IdP is registered — it's the SP's
  signing identity; regenerating it breaks every already-trusted IdP
  relationship until you re-register. `kortix self-host env rotate` refuses it
  for this reason.
- First-login auto-provisioning ("does every SSO sign-in land in the right
  account automatically?") is governed by the account's `auto_create_members`
  setting and its SSO group→role mappings — see `docs/ENTRA_SSO_SCIM_SETUP.md`
  Part A/C; it is not a self-host-specific concern once the plumbing above is
  in place.

## Restricting account creation

By default only the admin (`KORTIX_PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAILS`) creates new
accounts/organizations on a self-hosted instance; everyone else joins an
existing account by invitation or SSO. This is narrower than the removed
single-account mode — signups still work, existing teams/orgs still fully
function, and SSO/JIT still lands users in their org; only `POST
/v1/accounts` (spinning up a brand-new organization) is gated to platform
admins. `kortix self-host init`/`configure` ask about it as part of
"Deployment shape" (default Yes); disable it with:

```sh
kortix self-host env set KORTIX_RESTRICT_ACCOUNT_CREATION=false KORTIX_PUBLIC_RESTRICT_ACCOUNT_CREATION=false
```

## Backups

There is no separate backup system — it's plain Docker volumes and bind
mounts under the instance directory
(`~/.config/kortix/self-host/<instance>/`):

- `volumes/db/data` — the Postgres data directory (**the durable state that
  matters**: every table, every row).
- `volumes/storage` — Supabase Storage (uploaded files).
- `.env` — every secret and config value for the instance (JWT signing keys,
  API keys, GitHub/Daytona/SMTP credentials). Back this up separately and
  keep it at least as protected as a password vault.
- Two named Docker volumes, both fully regenerable and low-value to back up:
  `kortix-caddy-data` (cached ACME certificates — a fresh cert is issued
  automatically on next start if lost) and `kortix-updater-state` (just the
  updater's lock file + last-deployed breadcrumb).

**Whole-directory snapshot** (simplest, works everywhere a block/file-level
snapshot is available — EBS snapshot, a VPS provider's volume snapshot,
`rsync`, `tar`):

```sh
kortix self-host stop
tar -C ~/.config/kortix/self-host -czf kortix-self-host-backup.tar.gz <instance>
kortix self-host start
```

**Logical backup** (portable across Postgres versions, no downtime required):

```sh
docker compose --project-name kortix-<instance> \
  --env-file ~/.config/kortix/self-host/<instance>/.env \
  -f ~/.config/kortix/self-host/<instance>/docker-compose.yml \
  exec supabase-db pg_dump -U postgres -d postgres > backup-$(date +%F).sql
```

Restore is the inverse: stop the stack, restore `volumes/db/data` (whole-
directory approach) or `psql < backup.sql` against a fresh instance (logical
approach), then start.

### Backup & disaster recovery (enterprise)

For a production / enterprise deployment, "we have backups" is not a
finished answer — an untested backup is a liability. State and verify four
things explicitly:

- **RPO (data-loss window).** With only the on-box Postgres data directory,
  a box that dies between backups loses everything since the last backup.
  Pick a cadence and state it: a daily `pg_dump` (logical, ~24h RPO) is the
  floor; for tighter RPO use a host-level block snapshot of the instance
  directory on a schedule (EBS snapshots, your VPS provider's volume
  snapshots, or a `cron` + `rsync`/`tar` to a separate host). The whole-
  directory `tar` approach above requires `kortix self-host stop` (brief
  downtime); the `pg_dump` logical approach does not.
- **RTO (recovery-time objective).** A fresh box: provision → `kortix
  self-host init` → restore `.env` + `volumes/db/data` (or `psql <
  backup.sql`) → `kortix self-host start`. State how long that takes on
  YOUR box and practice it once (below).
- **`.env` is the root of trust.** Lose `volumes/db/data` and you lose
  data; lose `.env` and you lose the ability to ever authenticate or
  decrypt existing data even after a DB restore — `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`
  and `SAML_PRIVATE_KEY` in particular pin all issued sessions and SSO
  trust. Back `.env` up **separately** (not just inside the instance
  directory snapshot), at a provider/secrets vault with independent
  durability, and treat it as a credential.
- **Restore drill (run once before going live, then ~quarterly).** An
  untested restore procedure is not a restore procedure. On a throwaway
  box:
  1. `kortix self-host init` a fresh instance with the SAME domain (or a
     test domain) — do NOT start it yet.
  2. Restore the backed-up `.env` over the freshly-generated one (so JWT
     keys match the restored DB).
  3. Restore data: `psql < backup.sql` (logical) against the running
     `supabase-db`, or `kortix self-host stop` then replace
     `volumes/db/data` (whole-directory).
  4. `kortix self-host start`; verify sign-in with an existing account
     works (proves JWT keys + DB are consistent) and one project/session
     loads (proves Storage + DB rows).
  5. Record how long steps 1-4 took — that's your real RTO.

A deployment is not enterprise-ready until the restore drill has succeeded
at least once against a backup taken from the production instance.

## Uninstalling / starting over

`kortix self-host uninstall` is the full, clean teardown for one instance: it
stops the stack, runs `docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans`
(containers, networks, and the two named Docker volumes above — NOT a
substitute for the backup step if you need the data), deletes the instance's
config directory (`~/.config/kortix/self-host/<instance>/`, including
`.env` and `volumes/`), and clears the CLI's `selfhost` host entry if it
still points at this instance.

```sh
kortix self-host uninstall                    # interactive: type the instance name to confirm
kortix self-host uninstall --yes              # non-interactive / scripts
kortix self-host uninstall --instance staging # a specific --instance
```

**This permanently deletes all data for that instance** (Postgres, Storage,
every secret) — take a backup first if you might need it. Reinstalling is
just `init` + `start` again, on the same box or a fresh one.

## Troubleshooting

- **`docker compose version` fails / "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"** —
  Docker isn't installed or the daemon isn't running.
  `scripts/kortix-selfhost-up.sh` installs and starts it; on an existing box,
  `systemctl status docker` (Linux) or open Docker Desktop (local machine).
- **A newly created Linux user can't run `docker` without `sudo`** — group
  membership (`usermod -aG docker $USER`) only takes effect in a *new* login
  session; log out/in or start a new shell.
- **`kortix self-host doctor` reports a Compose config error** — usually a
  bad manual edit via `env set`; run `kortix self-host env ls` to see what's
  actually persisted, fix the offending key, and doctor again.
- **Sessions fail to start / "sandbox runtime not configured"** — `DAYTONA_API_KEY`
  isn't set. `kortix self-host configure` or
  `kortix self-host env set DAYTONA_API_KEY=...` then `kortix self-host start`.
- **Creating a project fails ("provider github not configured")** — managed
  git isn't configured. Same fix, with the `MANAGED_GIT_GITHUB_*` keys above.
- **Agent sessions fail with "Cannot connect to the API" / a `KORTIX_URL`
  error, or hang forever** — the cloud sandbox can't call back to this API:
  reachability is unconfigured (the default absent `--domain`/`--tunnel`), or
  a Cloudflare quick tunnel's URL wasn't captured yet. Run
  `kortix self-host configure` to set up a domain or `--tunnel cloudflare`,
  or re-run `kortix self-host start` — see Reachability above. Check
  `kortix self-host logs cloudflared` if a tunnel is configured but the URL
  capture keeps timing out (cloudflared may be missing its image locally yet,
  or outbound network access to Cloudflare may be blocked).
- **ACME/TLS cert issuance fails** — confirm the domain's (and API domain's)
  DNS A/AAAA record actually resolves to the box's public IP, and that ports
  80/443 are open in any cloud/VPS firewall or security group — HTTP-01
  validation needs both reachable from the internet.
- **After `kortix self-host update`, the app looks unchanged** — check
  `kortix self-host version`; if you're tracking `stable` and the release
  pipeline hasn't published a `:stable` tag for the new version yet, see the
  auto-updater section above. `--channel latest` or an explicit `--tag` always
  reflects what's actually published.
- **Logs** — `kortix self-host logs [service]` (services: `frontend`,
  `kortix-api`, `llm-gateway`, `kortix-updater`, `caddy` when a domain is
  configured, `cloudflared` when tunnel mode is configured, plus the Supabase
  services `supabase-db`, `supabase-kong`, `supabase-auth`, etc.).
