# Discover connector marketplace

## Product contract

Keep the existing Pipedream-backed "Easy Connect" catalogue unchanged. Add Discover
as a sibling tab behind the per-project `connectors_api_discover` experimental flag.
The flag is always available, explicit opt-in, and off by default. When disabled,
Discover is not mounted and makes no catalogue requests. Easy Connect remains the
default tab whenever it is available.

Discover's inventory is the complete public integrations.sh index. A direct card
represents a domain's available surfaces and must not be labelled as MCP-only merely
because the public index was sourced from an MCP feed. Opening it shows the
individually labelled OpenAPI, Postman, MCP, GraphQL, HTTP documentation, and CLI
variants attributed to their real source.

Pipedream is not a generic API proxy. It contributes only applications whose
Pipedream `auth_type` is exactly `oauth`. Those applications may appear as separate
cards, are always labelled `Pipedream OAuth`, and are ordered after direct catalogue
results. API-key Pipedream apps are excluded because Kortix can connect to those APIs
directly without an intermediary.

Built-in channels such as Slack remain in Channels and are excluded from Pipedream.

## Data flow

1. The API fetches and validates `https://integrations.sh/api.json`, caches it in
   memory, and serves searchable cursor pages. The browser never calls the third
   party directly.
2. Selecting a direct card asks the API for that domain's
   `https://integrations.sh/api/{domain}/surface` document. The API normalizes all
   domain surfaces into executable and documentation-only variants.
3. Executable OpenAPI, MCP, and GraphQL variants become existing connector drafts.
   Base-URL/docs-only and CLI variants remain discoverable but link to documentation
   instead of creating an empty connector.
4. Discover reads the existing Pipedream catalogue independently and includes only
   OAuth apps. Easy Connect keeps its current catalogue and behavior.

## Reliability and safety

- Use bounded upstream timeouts, schema guards, a TTL cache, request coalescing, and
  stale-on-refresh-failure behavior.
- The detail endpoint resolves domains only from a previously validated catalogue
  record; user input never becomes an arbitrary fetch target.
- Do not persist or vendor integrations.sh data. Retain upstream IDs, icons, domains,
  formats, and documentation URLs for attribution.
- A catalogue outage must produce an explicit retryable error and must not disable
  Channels or Custom connector creation.

## Public SDK additions

Add typed, additive catalogue records, surface variants, list/detail functions, and
the Pipedream `authType: 'oauth'` field. No existing export or connector contract is
renamed or removed.

## Acceptance criteria

- With the flag off, the Discover tab is absent and Easy Connect is unchanged.
- With the flag on, Discover appears beside Easy Connect; Easy Connect remains the
  default when available. If Easy Connect is unavailable, Discover becomes default.
- Search returns integrations.sh records and separately-labelled Pipedream OAuth
  alternatives in the same marketplace grid.
- Direct cards are labelled `Direct surfaces`, not as only MCP/OpenAPI/CLI based on
  the feed record that led to the domain.
- Pipedream `keys`, `none`, or missing-auth apps never appear.
- A real integrations.sh OpenAPI record can be added and synchronized through the
  existing connector path; a real remote MCP record can be added when it has an
  endpoint.
- HubSpot/Notion-style docs-only surfaces remain listed and clearly explain why they
  need manual configuration instead of presenting a broken Connect button.
- Slack appears only as the built-in channel.
