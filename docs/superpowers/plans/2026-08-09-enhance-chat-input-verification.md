# Enhance Chat Input — verification

**Task:** 14 (verification) of the composer rebuild
**Branch:** `message-input`
**Base:** `1fd281f897` (last commit before the rebuild)
**Head at verification:** `8ed4c9c4d6` + this task's commit
**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-09-enhance-chat-input-design.md`
**Ledger:** `.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-09-enhance-chat-input/progress.md`

The old implementation is gone from the tree. Every "old" citation below is read
from `git show 1fd281f897:apps/web/src/features/session/session-chat-input.tsx`
(1,382 lines; the spec's line numbers match it).

## 0. Summary

**Four of the 24 rows regressed. All four are now fixed, and all four are
PROVEN by mutation.** The most consequential was row 10: `Shift+Enter` produced
a `hardBreak` node that the send-path serializer turned into the empty string,
so **every multi-line message reached the agent with its line breaks deleted and
the surrounding words glued together** (`line one` + Shift+Enter + `line two`
was sent as `line oneline two`). It hid because the existing test asserted
`editor.getText()`, which walks the document by a different route and *does*
return the newline — the tested path and the shipped path disagreed.

Every row carries exactly one verdict. The three below partition all 24:

| Verdict | Count | Rows |
|---|---|---|
| PROVEN | **6** | 1, 10, 18, 21, 23, 24 |
| CODE-VERIFIED | **17** | 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22 |
| UNVERIFIABLE HERE | **1** | 12 |
| **Total** | **24** | |

"Regressed, then fixed" is **not** a fourth verdict — it is a property of four
rows that already appear above. Those four are **rows 1, 10, 18 and 21**, a
subset of the six PROVEN: each was found broken, fixed in this task, and bound
by a test whose binding was confirmed by reverting the fix and watching the
named tests fail.

All four regressions restore documented pre-rewrite behaviour. None of them is a
new product direction.

### Gates

| Gate | Result | Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| `bun test src/features/session` | **1394 pass, 0 fail** (121 files) | 1360 pass — +34 added here, all additive |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | **15 errors**, none in `composer/` | 15 pre-existing (2 `src/app/`, 6 `preview-fit.test.tsx`, 7 `easy-panel-logic.test.ts`) |
| `npx eslint src/features/session/composer/` | **3 warnings, 0 errors** | 3 warnings, 0 errors |
| `git diff -- packages/sdk` | **empty** | required zero-diff |
| Protected suites diff | **empty** (§5) | required zero-diff |
| Test lines removed | **0** | no test weakened, skipped or deleted |

---

## 1. Method, and what each verdict means

- **PROVEN** — a test exercises the row's user-visible behaviour. Where marked
  "by mutation", the implementation was broken on purpose, the named test was
  watched to fail, and the change was reverted.
- **CODE-VERIFIED** — no test covers the row end-to-end, but both
  implementations were read and they agree, cited `file:line` on each side.
- **UNVERIFIABLE HERE** — genuinely needs a browser. The precise interaction
  that would settle it is stated.
- **REGRESSED** — the behaviour is gone or changed.

**A tested pure helper is not a proven row.** Many rows call a pure function
that has its own passing suite (`resolveComposerResetOnSend`,
`shouldQueueInsteadOfSend`, `resolveEditorPlaceholder`,
`planFailedSendRecovery`). Those suites prove the *helper*. They do not prove
that `composer.tsx` still calls it, with the right arguments, at the right
moment. This was demonstrated during Task 13: a reviewer replaced the entire
failed-send recovery block with `if (false && …)` and the suite stayed at
1340/1340 pass. Rows in that situation are recorded as CODE-VERIFIED with the
helper's test named, never as PROVEN.

No browser and no dev stack were used — a standing instruction for this repo.

### Row 1 — Prefill: starter prompts, and failed-send recovery in `merge` mode

**Verdict: REGRESSED — FIXED IN THIS TASK. Now PROVEN by mutation.**

(`replace` mode was always correct; `merge` mode was not.)

- **Old** `session-chat-input.tsx:349-381` —
  `setText(current => prefillMode === 'merge' ? mergeFailedSubmissionText(current, prefillText) : prefillText)`.
  `mergeFailedSubmissionText(current, submitted)` returns
  `` `${submitted}\n\n${current}` `` (`composer-draft-recovery.ts:5-9`) — the
  **prefill first**, the user's in-flight draft after — and dedupes
  (`if (!submitted || current === submitted) return current`).
- **New** `composer/composer.tsx:801-823` —
  `editorRef.current?.setContent(prefillText, prefillMode === 'merge' ? 'merge' : 'replace')`.
  `setContent`'s merge branch (`composer/editor/composer-editor.tsx:485-489`) is
  `editor.commands.insertContent([{ type: 'paragraph' }, ...paragraphs])`, which
  inserts **at the current selection** and appends **after** existing content,
  with no dedupe.

**Evidence — measured, not inferred.** A throwaway probe drove a real headless
`@tiptap/core` editor with the production extension set and the verbatim
`setContent` merge branch, and read the result through the production
`serializeDocument`:

```
ROW1 ordering  OLD="recovered\n\nmy draft"   NEW="my draft\n\nrecovered"
ROW1 dedupe    OLD="same"                    NEW="same\n\nsame"
ROW1 emptytext OLD="my draft"  NEW="my draft"  | doc childCount 1 -> 3
```

Three distinct deltas:

1. **Ordering inverted.** The recovered draft used to land above what the user
   typed while the send was failing. It now lands below it.
2. **Dedupe gone.** Re-applying an identical prefill used to be a no-op; it now
   duplicates the text.
3. **Files-only prefill injects blank lines.** `shouldApplyPrefill` returns
   `true` for `prefillText: ''` when files are present (`composer-logic.ts:156`,
   asserted at `composer-logic.test.ts:79`). The serialized wire text is
   unchanged, but the document gains two empty paragraphs (`childCount 1 → 3`) —
   two blank lines the user sees and has to delete.

**Live callers of `mode: 'merge'`** (both reachable):
`session-chat.tsx:3946` (`failedStartDraft` — the failed-first-turn recovery,
and the one that can carry empty text plus files) and `session-chat.tsx:3949`
(`sessionPrefill` — the rewind / "Ask for changes" hand-off).
`session-chat.tsx:3384` builds the same `failedStartDraft` shape for
`chatPrefill`.

**Also:** `mergeFailedSubmissionText` and `mergeFailedSubmissionMentions` now
have **zero production consumers** (`grep` across `src/`, excluding their own
module, returns nothing). Their tests in the protected
`composer-draft-recovery.test.ts` still pass but no longer guard any shipped
path.

**What still works:** `replace` mode (starter prompts —
`project-home.tsx:223`; the rewind draft — `session-chat.tsx:3939`) is
equivalent. The *separate* in-composer failed-send recovery in `handleSubmit`'s
catch block is **not** affected — it uses `mergeFailedSubmissionDocument`
(`composer-draft-recovery.ts:47-60`), which keeps submitted-first ordering and
its own dedupe, and every branch is asserted in `composer-logic.test.ts:194-332`.

**The `editorReady` guard is PROVEN.** Deleting `if (!editorReady) return false;`
from `shouldApplyPrefill` kills 1 test in `composer-logic.test.ts` (21 pass / 1
fail); reverted clean. So the Task 12 Critical fix — a prefill arriving before
the lazy editor chunk resolves — is bound.

**Fix (this task).** `composer.tsx`'s prefill effect now routes `merge` mode
through `planPrefillMerge` (`composer-logic.ts`) instead of
`setContent(prefillText, 'merge')`. `planPrefillMerge` delegates to
`mergeFailedSubmissionDocument`, which already implements
`mergeFailedSubmissionText`'s exact three-branch contract — on documents rather
than strings, so mention atoms on either side survive, which the string version
could never have done in this editor. It returns `null` for "leave the document
alone", the same contract `planFailedSendRecovery.restoreDoc` uses, which
restores both no-op branches *and* preserves the user's caret by skipping the
write entirely.

`textToParagraphs`/`textToDocument` moved from `editor/composer-editor.tsx` into
`composer-logic.ts` so both files share one definition. That direction matters:
`composer-editor.tsx` is behind the `React.lazy` boundary, so importing a value
*from* it would have pulled TipTap and ProseMirror into the first-paint bundle.
`composer-logic.ts` imports `JSONContent` as a type only and stays runtime-free
of TipTap.

**Bound by 9 new tests.** Five in `composer-logic.test.ts` under
`describe('planPrefillMerge — merge-mode prefill restores the live semantics')`
cover prefill-first ordering, the identical-prefill dedupe, the files-only
no-op, the empty-composer case, and mentions carried through from both sides.
Four more in `composer-editor.test.ts` drive the whole path through a real
headless editor and assert the serialized result **equals
`mergeFailedSubmissionText(current, prefill)` itself** — pinning the restored
behaviour to the original implementation rather than to my reading of it — plus
the spelled-out string, the `childCount` guard for the files-only case, and the
structured `mentions` array after a merge.

**Mutation-verified, twice:**

| Mutation | Result |
|---|---|
| Swap the argument order so the prefill lands last again | **6 tests fail** |
| Replace `merged === currentDoc ? null : merged` with `merged` (drops dedupe and the empty-prefill no-op) | **4 tests fail** |

Both reverted; 70 pass across the two files.

**Still true after the fix:** `mergeFailedSubmissionText` and
`mergeFailedSubmissionMentions` remain without production consumers. The
document-level `mergeFailedSubmissionDocument` genuinely subsumes them — it is
now the single implementation behind both the failed-send catch block and
merge-mode prefill. `mergeFailedSubmissionText` is still *referenced* by the new
row-1 tests, deliberately, as the executable definition of the behaviour being
preserved. Deleting the two orphans is a reasonable follow-up, but it would
remove that oracle, so it is flagged rather than done.

---

### Row 2 — Draft saved and restored around a structured question

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

- **Old** `:383-394` — `savedTextBeforeQuestionRef.current = text; setText('')`
  on lock; `else if (saved) { setText(saved); saved = '' }` on unlock. Dep
  `[lockForQuestion]`.
- **New** `composer/composer.tsx:840-849` — `isEmpty()` decides whether to save,
  `getDocument()` snapshots, `clear()` empties; on unlock
  `setDocumentWithoutStealingFocus(…, 'replace')`. Same single dep.

Two deliberate improvements, both verified: the snapshot is now the ProseMirror
document, so mention atom nodes survive the round trip (the string round trip
flattened them to inert `@label` text and silently dropped the next send's
`<file_ref>` block); and the restore no longer steals focus
(`composer.tsx:295-307`), matching the old `setText`, which never moved focus.

**Open sub-case:** if `lockForQuestion` flips true before the lazy editor chunk
resolves, `editorRef.current` is `null` → nothing is saved *and* `clear()`
no-ops, so the draft stays visible under the question. The old code held `text`
in React state and always cleared. Unlike the prefill effect, this one does not
watch `editorElement`. Narrow (a question requires a completed server turn) but
real.

---

### Row 3 — Composer locked while a connector approval is pending

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

| Leg | Old | New |
|---|---|---|
| Submit guard | `:751-754` `toast.error('Approve or deny the pending action to continue.')` | `composer.tsx:904-907`, byte-identical |
| Send disabled | `:740` `submitDisabled = disabled \|\| modelUnavailable \|\| lockForApproval` | `composer.tsx:774`, identical |
| Input inert | `:1307` `disabled={disabled \|\| lockForApproval}` on the textarea | `composer.tsx:1202` `disabled={editorDisabled}` → `editable: !disabled` (`composer-editor.tsx:405`, `:459-461`) |
| Placeholder + amber | `:1232-1235` inline `text-amber-600 dark:text-amber-400` | `resolveEditorPlaceholder` (`composer-logic.ts:189`, same string) + `.composer-locked-approval` → `globals.css:2050,2053`, scoped to `p.is-editor-empty:first-child::before` |

Placeholder precedence has a helper test — `composer-logic.test.ts:128`
`'lockForApproval wins over lockForQuestion when staged command is not active'`.
That proves the helper; the call site (`composer.tsx:1042` → `:1201`) is
code-verified.

**Notes.** `useComposerFocus` is now disabled under `disabled || lockForApproval`
(`composer.tsx:756`) where the old global redirect checked `disabled` alone —
strictly tighter, and this task hoisted the condition so it can no longer drift
(§3, item 14). Unchanged in both: file attach and drag/drop gate on
`disabled || lockForQuestion`, **not** `lockForApproval`, so files can still be
attached during an approval lock. The amber colour is CSS-only and untested.

---

### Row 4 — Submitting while busy enqueues instead of sending

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

Old `:826-836` and new `composer.tsx:958-968` are the same call with the same
argument expressions, in the same position (after
`resolveComposerResetOnSend`, before `await onSend`), with the same early
`return`. `message-queue-boundary.ts` is byte-unchanged.

Its suite (`message-queue-boundary.test.ts`, protected and unmodified) covers
the **pure helper** — `'queues while the agent is running'`, `'queues behind
anything already waiting, even when the session reads idle'`, `'queues while a
claimed message is on the wire'`. No test exercises `handleSubmit`.

Only difference: `mentionsToSend` now comes from
`editorRef.current.getContent().mentions` (`composer.tsx:944`) instead of a
parallel `mentions` state array.

---

### Row 5 — Failed queued messages render below the queue with retry

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

Old `:1135-1146` and new `composer.tsx:1084-1095` pass identical props to
`QueuedMessages`, inside an identical wrapper condition, with the same
`EMPTY_QUEUE` fallback. `queued-messages.tsx` and `queued-messages-logic.ts` are
both byte-unchanged; the failed block still lives at `queued-messages.tsx:366-402`
(separate `<ul>` after the queue, `WarningIcon`, `lastError`, Retry, Dismiss).
Parent wiring at `session-chat.tsx:3954`/`:3961` is untouched.

`queued-messages-logic.test.ts` (protected, unmodified) covers
expand/summary/reorder/focus helpers, none of the failed-list rendering.

---

### Row 6 — Drag-and-drop file attach, with nested-enter depth counting

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

All four handlers are character-identical (old `:522-568` ↔ new
`composer.tsx:457-503`), including the depth counting
(`dragDepthRef.current += 1` / `Math.max(0, … - 1)` / reset to `0` on drop) and
including the detail that `handleDragLeave` deliberately omits the
`disabled || lockForQuestion` gate so the counter can never strand. Same
attachment point (`cardRef`), same overlay copy key.

**The one thing that genuinely changed — and it is safe.** The drop target is
now a ProseMirror `contenteditable`, not a `<textarea>`, so ProseMirror has its
own `drop` handler on `view.dom`. Read from the installed
`prosemirror-view@1.42.0/dist/index.cjs:3593-3625`: `handleDrop` calls
`event.preventDefault()` in two places and **never** `stopPropagation()`.
For a files-only drop `parseFromClipboard` yields no slice, so it returns at
`if (!slice) return;` without even preventing default. Either way the event
still reaches the card's React `onDrop`. `composer-editor.tsx` / `extensions.ts`
register no `handleDrop`, `handleDOMEvents` or drag handlers of their own.

Not covered by a test; `attachment-tiles.test.tsx` covers tile layout and
removal, not the drag path.

---

### Row 7 — Paste-to-attach images and files

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

The handler body is verbatim (old `:570-580` ↔ `composer.tsx:527-533`), moved
from the textarea's React `onPaste` to a **capture-phase** native listener on
`editorElement` (`composer.tsx:534`). Capture is what wins the ordering:
ProseMirror registers `editHandlers.paste` on `view.dom` in the bubble phase at
construction (`prosemirror-view/dist/index.cjs:3538`), and a paste's real target
is a descendant text node, so a capture listener on the ancestor runs first.
`extractClipboardFiles` is unchanged and has 7 tests in `clipboard-files.test.ts`
— the **pure helper** only.

**Open sub-cases:** `preventDefault()` does not stop ProseMirror's own paste
handler from running; for a files-only clipboard it finds nothing to insert and
falls into `capturePaste`, which focuses a hidden contenteditable and restores
focus ~50 ms later — a focus round-trip the textarea never had. Visible only in
a browser. Also, the new guard is `disabled || lockForQuestion`, whereas the old
`disabled` textarea received no paste event at all under `lockForApproval`.

---

### Row 8 — Staged command badge, args entry, Esc to cancel

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

Badge JSX is byte-identical (old `:1191-1218` ↔ `composer.tsx:1143-1170`); args
submit is the same (`:757-772` ↔ `composer.tsx:909-923`) with
`text.trim()` replaced by `(editorRef.current?.getContent().text ?? '').trim()`;
Escape moved from the textarea's `onKeyDown` first branch (`:922-929`) to a
native `keydown` listener (`composer.tsx:561-576`) with the same body.

The placeholder is PROVEN at the helper: `composer-logic.test.ts:117`
`'staged command wins over everything else'` asserts the exact string with
`lockForApproval` and `lockForQuestion` both true.

**Ordering note, outcome unchanged:** the suggestion plugin consumes Escape
first (`@tiptap/suggestion@3.27.1/dist/index.cjs:175-179`), but the composer's
listener does not check `defaultPrevented`, so the staged command is still
cancelled. **Improvement, not a regression:** `composer.tsx:1197-1198` passes
`EMPTY_COMMANDS`/`EMPTY_ACTIONS` while staged, so the `/` palette is fully
suppressed during args entry; the old code only disabled slash *detection*.

---

### Row 9 — `Tab` cycles agents when no menu is open

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

`primaryAgents` is the same expression on both sides (`:312-315` ↔
`composer.tsx:423-426`), and `cycleAgent` (`composer.tsx:553-559`) carries the
same three guards, including `agentSelectorLocked`.

The "no menu is open" gate moved from *position* to *`defaultPrevented`*. Old:
the Tab branch sat after the mention and slash branches, whose `return`s were
the gate. New: `if (e.key === 'Tab' && !e.defaultPrevented)`. That is sound —
the controllers return `false` when `nav.getRows().length === 0`
(`mention-controller.ts:103`, `slash-controller.ts`), the suggestion plugin
returns that boolean, and `prosemirror-view/dist/index.cjs:3017-3020` calls
`event.preventDefault()` only when a handler returned true. ProseMirror's
listener is registered at construction, the composer's later on the same node,
both bubble — so ProseMirror always runs first. The zero-rows case therefore
falls through to agent cycling, matching old `:932`'s `mentionItems.length > 0`
guard.

**New Tab consumer the textarea could not have:** `@tiptap/extension-list` binds
`Tab: sinkListItem`. Inside a list, Tab indents and cycling steps aside;
`sinkListItem` returns false on the first item, where Tab still cycles. Also,
`cycleAgent` does not check `disabled` — not reachable in practice, since a
`contenteditable="false"` node is not focusable, but the guard the textarea got
for free is gone from the code. No test covers Tab.

---

### Row 10 — `Enter` sends, `Shift+Enter` newline

**Verdict: REGRESSED — FIXED IN THIS TASK. Now PROVEN by mutation.**

**Enter-sends is PROVEN by mutation.** Changing
`if (event.key === 'Enter' && !event.shiftKey)` to
`if (event.key === 'Enter')` in `createSubmitOnEnterHandler`
(`composer-editor.tsx:177`) kills 1 test in `composer-editor.test.ts`
(29 pass / 1 fail); reverted clean. The four handler tests at `:214`, `:229`,
`:247`, `:262` bind Enter, disabled-Enter, Shift+Enter and other keys.

**Shift+Enter was broken on the send path.** `Shift+Enter` reaches
`@tiptap/extension-hard-break`'s keymap and inserts a `hardBreak` inline leaf.
`serializeDocument` — the **real** send path
(`composer-editor.tsx:481 getContent()` → `composer.tsx:939` → `onSend(text,…)`)
— serialized that leaf to the **empty string**:

```
HB childCount        = 1
HB getText()         = "line one\nline two"      <- what every existing test asserted
HB serializeDocument = "line oneline two"        <- what was actually sent
HB hardBreak spec.leafText = undefined
```

Root cause, `composer/editor/serialize.ts:89-91`: `doc.textBetween(0, size,
'\n', leafTextFn)`. Passing an explicit `leafText` **function** makes
ProseMirror use it for *every* inline leaf and ignore `node.type.spec.leafText`;
`hardBreak` has no `spec.leafText` of its own, so it fell to the `return ''`
default. The `blockSeparator` argument only applies at block boundaries, so
multi-**paragraph** text serialized correctly (`"para one\npara two"`) and hid
the single-paragraph case.

Why the suite could not see it: the nearest test,
`composer-editor.test.ts:533` `'splits on newlines into hard breaks rather than
corrupting via a bare-string HTML parse'`, asserts on `editor.getText()`, which
walks the document by a different route and *does* return the newline. The
tested path and the shipped path disagreed.

**User impact:** type `line one`, Shift+Enter, `line two`; the composer shows
two lines; the agent receives `line oneline two`, with the last and first words
glued together. Every multi-line message sent with Shift+Enter — the documented
way to insert a newline — was affected. `Mod+Enter` had the identical defect.

**Fix (this task):** `serialize.ts` now returns `'\n'` for `hardBreak`.

**Bound by 5 new tests** in `composer-editor.test.ts`, under
`describe('serializeDocument — Shift+Enter hard breaks reach the wire (matrix
row 10)')`, all asserting through `serializeDocument` rather than `getText()`:
hard break → newline; the words are never glued; multi-line `insertAtCursor`
round-trips; mentions still serialize as `@label` alongside a hard break;
paragraph boundaries unchanged (control).

**Mutation-verified:** removing the one-line fix kills **4 of the 5** new tests
(26 pass / 4 fail) — the fifth is the paragraph control and correctly survives.
Restored; 30 pass.

---

### Row 11 — Typing anywhere on the page focuses the composer

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

The guard list is identical — `isTextEditingElement` is copied verbatim
(`hooks/use-composer-focus.ts:6-12` ↔ `:399-405`), `isVisible` is the same
`offsetParent !== null`, and the modifier/`key.length !== 1`/`defaultPrevented`
checks match (`use-composer-focus.ts:115-129` ↔ `:405-423`). The new version
adds `el.contains(document.activeElement)`, needed because the target is now a
contenteditable subtree.

Insertion moved from `ta.setRangeText(e.key, start, end, 'end')` to
`onTypeAhead` → `insertAtCursor` → `insertTextAtCursor`
(`composer-editor.tsx:251-261`), which inserts inline at the selection with no
leading paragraph node. That is covered by
`composer-editor.test.ts:495` `'inserting mid-word keeps a single paragraph and
lands exactly at the cursor'` and its deliberate counter-example at `:506` — a
**pure function** test, not the component.

**Open sub-case:** after a raw `el.focus()` (not `view.focus()`), whether
ProseMirror's stored `state.selection` is still the user's pre-blur caret at the
instant `insertContent` runs is DOM timing, not code. The insertion is
synchronous and `selectionchange` is async, so it should hold, but only a
browser settles it.

An earlier iteration of this dropped the keystroke entirely for a non-empty
unfocused composer; that gate is gone (`composer.tsx:717-729` documents the
removal), so the mid-draft case is handled.

---

### Row 12 — `focus-session-textarea` focuses the visible composer

**Verdict: UNVERIFIABLE HERE**

The code is equivalent: the same 10-retry `requestAnimationFrame` chain against
the same `offsetParent` visibility predicate, on the same event name
(`use-composer-focus.ts:94-113` ↔ `:451-467`), plus two additive improvements
(an in-flight chain is cancelled before a new one starts; any pending frame is
cancelled on unmount). The sole dispatcher, `command-palette.tsx:732`, is
untouched.

**Why this row is not CODE-VERIFIED.** The old target — a `<textarea>` — existed
on the component's first render, so the retry loop could not miss. The new
target is behind `React.lazy` + `Suspense` and `immediatelyRender: false`, so
`ref.current` is `null` until the chunk resolves *and* TipTap constructs its
view. Ten animation frames is roughly 160 ms at 60 Hz. This event is a
**one-shot**: if it arrives during a cold-chunk window and the retries are
exhausted, the focus is lost and nothing re-arms it — the effect re-registers
the listener when `editorElement` appears, but it cannot replay a missed event.
This is the row's whole claim, and code reading cannot say how often 160 ms is
too short.

Contrast row 13, which is self-healing: that effect re-runs when the element
appears and focuses then.

**What would verify it:** in Chromium with the network throttled and the cache
disabled, open a session from the command palette (`command-palette.tsx:732`
dispatches `focus-session-textarea`) on a cold load, and assert
`document.activeElement` is the composer's contenteditable. Repeat warm as the
control.

---

### Row 13 — autoFocus when revealed inside a hidden tab

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

Same shape on both sides (`use-composer-focus.ts:63-82` ↔ `:475-499`): focus
immediately when `offsetParent !== null`, otherwise an `IntersectionObserver`
with `{ threshold: 0.1 }` that focuses and disconnects on first intersection.
The default is byte-identical:
`autoFocus ?? (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.innerWidth >= 640)`.

The observed element is real and correctly timed:
`composer.tsx:713-716` makes the ref a `useMemo` over `editorElement` (not a
plain `useRef`), specifically so the effect re-runs once the lazy editor
resolves — which is what keeps the reveal case working for a composer that
mounts hidden.

**Delta:** the old code additionally set React's native `autoFocus` attribute on
the `<textarea>` (`:1312`). The new code does **not** pass `autoFocus` to
`ComposerEditorLazy` (`composer.tsx:1198-1213`), even though
`composer-editor.tsx:404` supports `autofocus`. Focus now comes only from the
effect, which cannot run before the chunk resolves — so first-paint focus is
later than before. The mechanism is preserved; only the timing changed, and
unlike row 12 it is self-healing.

---

### Row 14 — Triple-`Esc` stop, with the ×2/×1 hint

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

`send-stop-control.tsx` is byte-identical (`git diff 1fd281f897..HEAD` empty),
including `{escCount > 0 && …}` and `{escCount === 1 ? '×2 to stop' : '×1 to
stop'}` at `:66-79`. The counter, the 4 s cooloff and the 1→2→3 progression all
live in `session-chat.tsx:3175-3242` and were never inside the composer. The
prop chain is intact: `session-chat.tsx:3963` → `composer.tsx:1249` →
`composer-toolbar.tsx:230` → `SendStopControl`.

**Open sub-case — a narrower first Escape.** Old suppressed Escape only when a
menu had rows (`:932`, `:958`). `@tiptap/suggestion@3.27.1` returns `true` for
Escape whenever the plugin is *active* — including with zero rows shown. So
typing `@zzzzz` (no matches) while the agent is busy now swallows the first
Escape instead of advancing the counter. User-visible as "the first ESC did
nothing".

---

### Row 15 — Sub-session "back to parent" indicator

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

The whole inline-chips block — the
`{(threadContext || sessionId || inputSlot || replyTo || queuedMessages?.length) &&`
gate, the `mx-3 mt-2.5 flex flex-col gap-1.5 empty:hidden` wrapper, and the
`threadContext` button with its `ArrowUpLeft` icon and `Sub-session of` copy —
diffs **identical** across 51 lines (old `:1135-1185` ↔ `composer.tsx:1084-1134`).
Type and destructure unchanged; `session-chat.tsx:3983` still supplies it.

Note: the `group-hover:` classes on the icon have no `group` ancestor in
*either* version — a pre-existing dead style carried over verbatim, not a
regression. No test.

---

### Row 16 — Reply-to banner and clear

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

Covered by the same identical-block diff as row 15: same JSX, same 120-character
truncation rule (`composer.tsx:1100`), same `onClearReply` button and aria-label
key (`:1108`). Props unchanged; `session-chat.tsx:3985-3986` still supplies
them. Whether the banner clears on send is parent-owned in both versions. No
test.

---

### Row 17 — Model connection gate bar and hard-disabled send

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

`noModelsConnected` is textually identical on both sides (`:733-738` ↔
`composer.tsx:761-766`), as is
`submitDisabled = disabled || modelUnavailable || lockForApproval` (`:740` ↔
`:774`) and the `modelUnavailable` toast (`:742-748` ↔ `:897-902`).
`model-connection-gate.tsx`, `use-model-connection-gate.ts` and
`model-availability.ts` are all byte-unchanged.

Plumbing verified: `composer.tsx:1227` passes the **gated**
`availableSelectedModel` (not the raw prop), `:1255`/`:1257` pass
`submitDisabled`/`modelUnavailable`, and `SendStopControl` hard-disables at
`send-stop-control.tsx:123-127` and swaps its aria-label/tooltip to
`NO_MODEL_AVAILABLE_ACTION_MESSAGE`.

`model-availability.test.ts` (protected, unmodified) proves the **helpers** —
`'blocks normal sends when a model is required but missing'`, `'removes a
selected model that is not usable for the account'`. No test renders `Composer`,
`ComposerToolbar`, `SendStopControl` or `ModelConnectionBar`.

**Note (not a gate weakening):** `canSubmit` changed from
`text.trim().length > 0 || attachedFiles.length > 0` to
`!isEmpty || attachedFiles.length > 0` (`composer.tsx:773`). ProseMirror's
`isEmpty` does not trim, so a whitespace-only document now enables the Send
button. `handleSubmit` still trims and no-ops (`:941`), so nothing blank is
sent. The model gate is enforced by `submitDisabled`, not `canSubmit`, so it is
untouched. Self-documented at `composer.tsx:767-772`.

---

### Row 18 — Token progress and context click-through

**Verdict: REGRESSED — FIXED IN THIS TASK. Now PROVEN by mutation.**

(Desktop was never affected; the control was gone below 640 px.)

- **Old** — `composer-toolbar.tsx` rendered `<TokenProgress …/>` bare inside
  `<div className="flex shrink-0 items-center gap-0">`. **No responsive class
  anywhere.**
- **New** — `composer.tsx:1242` passes
  `tokenProgressWrapperClassName="hidden sm:flex"`, and
  `composer-toolbar.tsx:203-211` wraps `TokenProgress` in that div.

**The wrapper was not moved — it is new.**
`git grep -n "hidden sm:flex" 1fd281f897 -- apps/web/src/features/session/`
returns **zero** hits; at `HEAD` it returns exactly one, `composer.tsx:1242`.
The `tokenProgressWrapperClassName` prop is itself added by this rebuild.

`hidden` is `display:none` below the `sm` breakpoint (640 px), so the ring, its
tooltip and its `onClick` are absent from the DOM on a phone or narrow window.
That ring is the **only** entry point to the context modal:
`session-chat.tsx:3425` `handleContextClick = () => setContextModalOpen(true)`
is referenced exactly once, at `:3984`; `setContextModalOpen` has no other
caller (declaration `:1541`, the dialog's `onOpenChange` `:3625`). So below
640 px `SessionContextModal` is unreachable.

`token-progress.tsx` itself is byte-identical and its own doc comment
(`:17-22`) argues against exactly this: *"Deliberately kept visible in BOTH the
simple and advanced composer toolbars … a quiet, non-interactive ring."*
`onContextClick` plumbing is otherwise intact and the ≥640 px rendering is
equivalent.

**This was deliberate, not accidental** — `progress.md:96` lists it as a Task 12
brief item: *"(e) TokenProgress `hidden sm:flex` belongs HERE not T10"*. It is
nonetheless a regression of a matrix row that was never authorized as a
deviation, and it costs mobile users all access to context usage and
compaction.

**Fix (this task).** The `tokenProgressWrapperClassName` prop is removed
outright — from `composer.tsx`'s call site, from `ComposerToolbarProps`, and
from the destructure — and `TokenProgress` renders unwrapped again. That also
deletes the dead `undefined`-wrapper branch and its stale doc comment ("the old
toolbar is still-live"), since `composer.tsx` is now the only `ComposerToolbar`
call site.

**Bound by 3 new tests** in the new `composer/composer-toolbar.test.tsx`,
under `describe('ComposerToolbar — TokenProgress is visible at every viewport
(matrix row 18)')`. They SSR-render the real `ComposerToolbar` with
`renderToStaticMarkup` — the shell `attachment-tiles.test.tsx` and
`projects/project-card.test.tsx` already use, which needs no jsdom and commits
no effects — and assert on the **rendered markup**, never on source text:

1. the ring renders at all (a guard, so the next two cannot pass vacuously);
2. no ancestor of it carries an unprefixed `hidden`;
3. no ancestor carries a breakpoint-gated display class at all
   (`sm:flex`, `md:block`, `max-sm:hidden`, …) — broader than the specific
   regression, so a different spelling of the same idea is also caught.

Ancestors are found by walking the markup with a tag-depth stack and snapshotting
it at the element carrying `data-slot="token-progress"`. That `data-slot` is a
one-line addition to `token-progress.tsx` and is this repo's standard stable
hook — 262 uses across `components/ui/*` — not a test-only marker.

**Mutation-verified:** reintroducing the exact `<div className="hidden sm:flex">`
wrapper kills **2 of the 3** tests; the third is the render guard and correctly
survives, since the ring still renders, just hidden. Reverted; 3 pass.

**An earlier draft of this document claimed no headless assertion was possible
here and recorded the row as CODE-VERIFIED. That was wrong** — the premise, not
the principle. The principle (a test that greps its own source for a class name
is false confidence) still holds; what I missed is that SSR-rendering the
component sidesteps source-grepping entirely. Two providers were needed
(`TooltipProvider`, `QueryClientProvider`), both DOM-free. There was no wall.

Also removed with the prop: the dead `undefined`-wrapper branch and its stale
doc comment ("the old toolbar is still-live"), since `composer.tsx` is now the
only `ComposerToolbar` call site. The rendered element is byte-identical to
base, and `grep -n "hidden sm:|sm:flex|max-sm:hidden" composer/*.tsx` now
matches only explanatory comments.

---

### Row 19 — Session scope toolbar, incl. new-session draft commit

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

`composer-chat-input.tsx` — which builds `<SessionScopeToolbar … onCommittedDraft={sessionId ? undefined : handleCommittedScope} />`
and folds it into `combinedToolbarSlot` — is **not in the diff at all**.
`composer.tsx:1238` passes `toolbarSlot` to `ComposerToolbar`, which renders it
at `composer-toolbar.tsx:221`, in the same position as before (between
`TokenProgress` and `VoiceRecorder`). `scope/session-scope-toolbar.tsx` is
untouched, including `commitSessionScopeDraft`'s `if (!sessionId)` branch
(`:135-141`) and the init effect at `:211`; its pure halves are tested
(`'commits a new-session draft without calling session replacement'`,
`'commits an unrestricted (null) secrets scope before the first prompt'`).

**The deliberate `session-scope-control.tsx` change is behaviour-preserving.**
The diff is exactly `-<Popover>` → `+<Popover open={open} onOpenChange={onOpenChange}>`
plus two optional props. Radix 1.1.18 resolves this through
`useControllableState`; with `open === undefined` it is uncontrolled, identical
to before. **No caller passes either prop** — the two `SessionScopeToolbar` call
sites (`composer-chat-input.tsx:147`, `session-chat.tsx:3441`) pass neither.

**Note:** the `/set-scope` slash row those props were added for is a no-op —
`composer.tsx:861-889` returns early for `set-scope`, `switch-model`,
`set-reasoning-effort` and `start-voice`. A documented new dead end, not a
regression of the toolbar. The React wiring (effect → `onCommittedDraft` →
`ComposerChatInput`) has no test.

---

### Row 20 — `clearOnSend={false}` does not clear or revoke URLs

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

Old `:805-812`/`:843` and new `composer.tsx:952-956`/`:972` are the same
`resolveComposerResetOnSend` call, the same `if (reset.clear)` block and the
same `for (const url of reset.urlsToRevoke) URL.revokeObjectURL(url)` loop.
`composer-reset.ts` is unchanged and still returns
`{ clear: false, urlsToRevoke: [] }` for `clearOnSend === false`.

`composer-reset.test.ts` (protected, unmodified) proves the **helper** —
`'clearOnSend=false → clears nothing and revokes no URLs (message survives
navigation)'`. The only consumer, `project-home.tsx:217`, is unchanged.

Three related paths all check out: the staged-command branch keeps its own
`if (clearOnSend)` gate with its per-file revoke loop (`:760-768` ↔ `:912-921`);
the failed-send restore is still gated on `clearOnSend` via
`planFailedSendRecovery`'s `if (!input.clearOnSend) return null`
(`composer-logic.ts:92`, tested); and `revokeObjectURL` call sites match 3-for-3
(`:585/:765/:843` ↔ `composer.tsx:508/917/972`).

---

### Row 21 — Voice transcription appends to existing text

**Verdict: REGRESSED — FIXED IN THIS TASK. Now PROVEN by mutation.**

(It always appended; it did not append the way it used to.)

- **Old** `:1050-1052` —
  `setText(prev => (prev ? \`${prev} ${transcribedText}\` : transcribedText))`.
  Always at the **end of the whole draft**, joined by a single **space**, never
  moving focus.
- **New** `composer.tsx:851-853` — `editorRef.current?.setContent(transcribedText, 'merge')`,
  whose merge branch is `insertContent([{ type: 'paragraph' }, …])` at the
  **current selection**, followed by `editor.commands.focus('end')`.

**Evidence — measured on a real headless editor via the production
`serializeDocument`:**

```
ROW21 separator  OLD="hello transcribed"      NEW="hello\n\ntranscribed"
ROW21 caret      caret parked after "hello" in "hello world"
                 NEW="hello\n\nXX\n world"     (the draft is split at the caret)
```

Three user-visible changes:

1. **Separator.** A space became a block boundary — `hello transcribed` is now
   sent as `hello\n\ntranscribed`.
2. **Insertion point.** Record with the caret parked mid-draft and the
   transcript splits the draft there, instead of appending at the end.
3. **Focus.** `setContent` ends with `focus('end')`; the old `setText` never
   moved focus. `handleTranscription` is the one restore-ish path that does
   **not** use the `withoutStealingFocus` wrapper (`composer.tsx:295`) the
   others do.

**Fix (this task).** `handleTranscription` now builds the next document with
`appendTranscribedText` (`composer-logic.ts`) and writes it through
`setDocumentWithoutStealingFocus` — the same wrapper the failed-send and
question-unlock restores already use, which is what keeps focus where the user
put it. `appendTranscribedText` appends the transcript to the **last block**
with a single leading space, which is what makes the separator a space rather
than a paragraph break. When the last block cannot hold inline text (a list,
blockquote or code block holds child *blocks*, so pushing a text node in would
build an invalid document) it starts a new paragraph instead, with no leading
space.

**Bound by 9 new tests.** Six in `composer-logic.test.ts` under
`describe('appendTranscribedText — voice transcription appends at the end with a space')`
cover the space separator, appending to the end of a multi-paragraph draft
without touching earlier blocks, the empty-composer case, the
non-paragraph-last-block fallback, the empty-transcription no-op, and a mention
atom surviving in the target paragraph. Three more in `composer-editor.test.ts`
assert the serialized result through a real editor: `"hello transcribed"` with
`childCount === 1`, `"hello world dictated"` with the caret parked mid-draft
(the regression produced `"hello\n\ndictated\n world"`), and no leading space
into an empty composer.

**Mutation-verified:** turning the space separator back into a pushed paragraph
kills **5 tests**. Reverted; 70 pass across the two files.

---

### Row 22 — Agent selector locked inside a meta-agent session

**Verdict: CODE-VERIFIED**

`composer.tsx:1225` passes `agentSelectorLocked` to `ComposerToolbar` exactly as
`:1337` did, and `cycleAgent` (`composer.tsx:553-559`) carries the same
`agentSelectorLocked` guard the old Tab branch had at `:982`.

Enforcement lives in files the rebuild barely touched:
`composer-toolbar.tsx:180 disabled={agentSelectorLocked}` →
`agent-selector.tsx:144` `onOpenChange={(next) => setOpen(disabled ? false : next)}`
and `:110` `onSelect={() => { if (disabled) return; … }}`. `agent-selector.tsx`'s
only diff versus base is the new optional `triggerLabelClassName`
(`max-w-[100px]` → `cn('max-w-[100px]', triggerLabelClassName)`) — styling only;
tooltip copy, `aria-disabled` and the gated popover are unchanged. The
meta-agent source (`composer-chat-input.tsx:124-127` → `:213`) is untouched.

**Note:** `composer.tsx:864 case 'switch-agent': cycleAgent()` adds a second
route to change agent (the `/` menu); it goes through the same guard, so it is
locked too. No test — `grep -rn agentSelectorLocked src` returns zero test files.

---

### Row 23 — Sessions match on the files they changed  *(added; not in spec §7)*

**Verdict: PROVEN — by mutation, helper and wiring both**

Old `:669-684` filtered candidate sessions by title, then session id, then
`s.summary?.diffs.some(d => (d.file || '').toLowerCase().includes(q))`, capped
at 5. New `menus/menu-items.ts:50-59` (`sessionMatchesQuery`) is the same three
checks in the same order, applied at `:87-90` after the identical
`!s.parentID && !s.time.archived && s.id !== currentSessionId` filter, with the
same `SESSION_LIMIT = 5`.

**Helper tests:** `menus/menu-items.test.ts:58`
`'matches a session by a changed file path in summary.diffs'` — query
`'auth.ts'`, two sessions with unrelated titles, asserts only the one whose diff
is `src/lib/auth.ts` survives. Plus `:99` `'does not match a session when the
diffs entry has no file field'`.

**Mutation:** deleting the `summary.diffs` branch from `sessionMatchesQuery`
kills exactly 1 test (6 pass / 1 fail). Restored; 7 pass.

**Wiring, read end to end:** `composer.tsx:421` `useRuntimeSessions()` →
`:1195-1196` `sessions={allSessions ?? []}` (unfiltered) →
`composer-editor.tsx:318-321` `sessionsRef` → `:420` `getSessions` →
`mention-controller.ts:75/:96` → `mention-menu.tsx:141 buildMentionSections(…)`.
No filter anywhere on that path.

**Cosmetic delta:** the row description separator changed from `-` to `·`
(`:689` ↔ `menu-items.ts:99`). Triaged as acceptable in §3, item 8.
`formatRelativeTime` also now takes an injected `now` fixed at menu-open time,
so timestamps no longer tick while a menu is open.

---

### Row 24 — The `@` menu lists hidden agents and subagents  *(added; not in spec §7)*

**Verdict: PROVEN — by mutation, helper and wiring both**

Old `:665` filtered the **raw** `agents` prop by name only. The filtered
`primaryAgents` (`:312-314`, `!a.hidden && a.mode !== 'subagent'`) fed Tab
cycling (`:982`) and the toolbar (`:1334`) — never the menu. So hidden agents
and subagents were `@`-mentionable, which is plausibly how a user delegates to a
subagent by name.

New `menus/menu-items.ts:82-84` applies the same name-only filter, with the
decision pinned in a comment at `:73-81`.

**Helper test:** `menus/menu-items.test.ts:86`
`'hidden and subagent agents ARE listed in the @ menu'` — feeds
`{name:'hidden-agent', hidden:true}` and `{name:'sub-agent', mode:'subagent'}`
and asserts both appear.

**Mutation:** inserting `.filter((a) => !a.hidden && a.mode !== 'subagent')`
before the name filter kills exactly 1 test (6 pass / 1 fail). Restored; 7 pass.

**Wiring — the split is preserved exactly:**
`composer.tsx:1194 agents={agents}` (the raw prop) goes to the editor and the
`@` menu; `composer.tsx:1222 agents={primaryAgents}` goes to `ComposerToolbar`
only; `primaryAgents`' only other use is `cycleAgent` (Tab). This mirrors the
old split one-for-one.

**Note:** `AgentSelector` applies its own `!a.hidden && a.mode !== 'subagent'`
filter internally (`agent-selector.tsx:52-55`), so the toolbar double-filters.
Pre-existing and unchanged.

## 3. Deferred-item triage

Extracted with
`grep -nE 'deferred|Route to T14|carry to T14' .superpowers/sdd/2026-08-09-enhance-chat-input/progress.md`
— 14 ledger lines, some bundling more than one item.

| # | Item | Source | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | No co-located test for `use-composer-focus.ts` | T1, `progress.md:4` | Acceptable to ship |
| 2 | `data ?? []` returns a fresh array each render | T2, `:10` | Acceptable to ship |
| 3 | `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` at `use-debounced-value.ts:21` | T2, `:11` | Acceptable to ship |
| 4 | `keepPreviousData` shows the **previous sandbox's** files | T2, `:14` | **MUST FIX — fixed here** |
| 5 | `trackEmptyBoundary` lifetime / `setContent` before editor / Chrome Android Enter | T3, `:35` | Acceptable to ship |
| 6 | Placeholder test reads `@internal` `decoration.type.attrs` | T3, `:39` | Acceptable to ship |
| 7 | `setEditable()` emits a redundant `update` | T3, `:40` | Acceptable to ship |
| 8 | Session description separator `·` vs `-` | T6, `:49` | Acceptable to ship |
| 9 | Escape now sticks via `dismissedRange`; `slash-items.test.ts` `as never` casts | T8, `:65` | Acceptable to ship |
| 10 | `allowedPrefixes` regex brittleness | T8, `:70` | Acceptable to ship |
| 11 | One-React-tick window where `@` + Enter submits | T8, `:71` | Acceptable to ship |
| 12 | `EMPTY_ACTIONS` seam — `/` menu over staged args | T12, `:118` | **Already resolved in T13** |
| 13 | Type-ahead drops the keystroke when non-empty + unfocused | T12, `:119` | **Already resolved in T13** |
| 14 | `disabled \|\| lockForApproval` duplicated at `:745` and `:1191` | T13, `:140` | **MUST FIX — fixed here** |

Two items (12, 13) were closed by Task 13 before this task ran — `EMPTY_ACTIONS`
is passed at `composer.tsx:1198`, and `insertAtCursor`
(`composer-editor.tsx:251-261`) replaced the dropped keystroke. That leaves 12
genuinely open, of which 2 are fixed here.

### Fixed — item 4: cross-sandbox file results in the `@` menu

**Why blocking.** A composer stays mounted across a session switch
(`session-chat.tsx:1506-1512` pre-mounts every open tab). Switching runtime
changes `server`, which changes the query key — and stock `keepPreviousData`
answers "yes, show the previous data" for *any* previous query, including one
that ran against a different sandbox, with `isLoading: false`. The `@` menu then
presents another workspace's file paths as if they were this one's. Selecting
one produces a `<file_ref>` for a path the agent cannot resolve. Wrong data
presented as authoritative, on the composer's main discovery path.

**Fix** (`composer/hooks/use-file-search.ts`): replaced `keepPreviousData` with a
guard that keeps the placeholder only while the `server` slot of the previous
query key matches the current one. The never-flash-empty behaviour during
typing is unchanged; only the cross-sandbox case is dropped.

One non-obvious detail is captured in the code comment: the guard is written
**inline**, not hoisted to a stable reference, because query-core reuses the
previous placeholder result *without re-consulting the function* whenever the
`placeholderData` option is referentially unchanged
(`queryObserver.js:267` — `prevResult?.isPlaceholderData && options.placeholderData === prevResultOptions?.placeholderData`).
A stable reference would let a cross-sandbox result survive the very switch this
guards against.

**Bound by 8 new tests** in the new `composer/hooks/use-file-search.test.ts`,
asserting the guard against the **real** key builder (`composerFileSearchKey`) so
the guard's index into that tuple cannot drift out of step with the key shape:
same-sandbox-different-query keeps, different-sandbox drops (including for an
identical query), the `unbound` sentinel is its own sandbox and not a wildcard,
no-previous-query drops, and a foreign key shape never matches by accident.

### Fixed — item 14: one definition of "the editor is inert"

**Why blocking.** `disabled || lockForApproval` appeared verbatim in two places
that must agree: `useComposerFocus({ disabled })`, which decides whether a
keystroke typed anywhere on the page is redirected **into** the editor, and the
`ComposerEditorLazy` `disabled` prop, which decides whether the editor accepts
it. They had already drifted once — Task 13, MINOR 2 — and that drift was a real
user-visible bug: with the type-ahead's `isEmpty()` gate removed, a stray
character could land **mid-draft** in a composer locked for a pending connector
approval. The duplication is the defect, and it sits on a surface with no
browser coverage.

**Fix** (`composer/composer.tsx`): hoisted to a single `editorDisabled` local
(`:446`), consumed at `:756` and `:1202`. Zero behaviour change — so no test is
added; the change makes a class of bug structurally impossible rather than
adding behaviour to assert. Verified by grep: the string
`disabled || lockForApproval` no longer appears anywhere in the file.

### Judged acceptable — reasoning

- **1 — no test for `use-composer-focus.ts`.** The hook is 100% DOM-coupled:
  `offsetParent` needs layout, and it uses `IntersectionObserver`,
  `requestAnimationFrame`, `window` listeners and `document.activeElement`. This
  repo registers no jsdom/happy-dom for `bun test`. Its two pure predicates are
  module-private and too small to justify a surface change. Recorded as a real
  coverage gap in §6 instead — it is the single largest one, covering rows 11,
  12 and 13.
- **2 — `data ?? []` fresh each render.** It cannot cause the render loop it
  looks like it could. The only re-render trigger for `MentionMenuHost` from
  this path is `renderer.updateProps({ selectedIndex })`
  (`mention-controller.ts:63`), and `ReactRenderer.updateProps` shallow-compares
  the keys it is given and returns early when nothing changed
  (`@tiptap/react@3.27.1/dist/index.js:704-718`). With `selectedIndex`
  unchanged, no re-render occurs, so the chain cannot sustain. Cost is a
  redundant `buildMentionSections` on renders that happen anyway.
- **3 — `set-state-in-effect` warning.** One more instance of the tolerated
  ~455-warning `react-hooks` family pending a dedicated audit. 0 errors.
- **5 — three sub-items.** `trackEmptyBoundary`'s `wasEmpty` is created once per
  `ComposerEditor` mount via `useMemo(…, [])` and `useEditor` is constructed
  once, so there is no desync path today. `setContent` before editor creation is
  closed for prefill (the `editorReady` guard, PROVEN by mutation); the only
  other caller is voice transcription, which cannot fire before the toolbar's
  mic button has been clicked and a recording has completed. Chrome Android's
  Enter bypass is upstream and unavoidable; the send button covers it.
- **6 — `@internal` decoration read in the placeholder test.** Test-only
  brittleness, disclosed in the test. A public alternative needs a DOM the file
  deliberately avoids. A `prosemirror-view` bump could break it with zero
  functional change; that is a loud, obvious failure, not a silent one.
- **7 — redundant `update` on `setEditable`.** Absorbed by
  `trackEmptyBoundary`'s boundary guard, which only forwards a genuine
  empty↔non-empty transition. Matters only if a future consumer wires `onUpdate`
  directly.
- **8 — `·` vs `-` separator.** `·` is the house convention: 484 occurrences
  across `apps/web/src`. This moves toward the design system, not away from it.
- **9 — Escape sticks; `as never` casts.** The Escape change is a genuine
  behaviour delta (the menu no longer re-opens on the next keystroke) but is
  the better behaviour, and it is bounded by the same trigger text. The casts are
  test hygiene.
- **10 — `allowedPrefixes` regex.** Upstream
  (`findSuggestionMatch.ts:55-58` builds a character class from
  `allowedPrefixes.join('')`), round-0 code, not a regression, and only bites if
  someone adds a prefix containing `-`, `]` or `^`.
- **11 — one-tick `@` + Enter window.** Structural to `ReactRenderer` plus a
  React effect. Requires pressing Enter inside the same React tick that opened
  the menu — under ~16 ms of a human keystroke. The failure mode is benign (the
  message sends, as the old composer did for a zero-row match).

## 4. Regressed rows — disposition

All four are fixed. Three restore behaviour that the old implementation
documented in code; the fourth reverses a change that was never authorized as a
matrix deviation.

| Row | Regression | Fix | Bound by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | Shift+Enter line breaks dropped from every sent message | `hardBreak` serializes to `'\n'` | 5 tests; mutation kills 4 |
| 1 | Merge-mode prefill: ordering inverted, dedupe gone, blank lines on files-only | `planPrefillMerge` -> `mergeFailedSubmissionDocument` | 9 tests; two mutations kill 6 and 4 |
| 21 | Voice transcription: block separator, caret insertion, focus steal | `appendTranscribedText` + `setDocumentWithoutStealingFocus` | 9 tests; mutation kills 5 |
| 18 | `TokenProgress` and the only route to the context modal hidden below 640 px | `tokenProgressWrapperClassName` removed entirely | 3 tests; mutation kills 2 |

All four are test-bound and mutation-verified. Row 18 was the doubtful one: an
earlier draft of this document argued no headless assertion was available and
recorded it as CODE-VERIFIED. That was an overstated premise —
`renderToStaticMarkup` SSR-renders the real toolbar with no jsdom, so the
assertion can be made against rendered markup rather than source text. The
principle that motivated the doubt (never let a test grep its own source for a
class name) is preserved; the conclusion drawn from it was wrong.

### Dependency removal

`@tiptap/extension-mention` is removed from `apps/web/package.json`. The
standing constraint was "no new dependencies", and this one earned nothing: the
mention node is hand-built in `composer/editor/mention-node.ts`.

Verified **by symbol**, not by import path — the trap this plan hit twice:
`grep -rn "extension-mention|MentionOptions|MentionPluginKey"` across
`apps/` and `packages/` returns only the `package.json` line itself. After
`pnpm install`, resolution genuinely fails:

```
$ node -e "require.resolve('@tiptap/extension-mention')"
DOES NOT RESOLVE (correct): MODULE_NOT_FOUND
```

The lockfile change is 15 deletions, all `@tiptap/extension-mention`, and
`@tiptap/suggestion` now resolves to a single `3.27.1` entry. All gates were
re-run against the pruned tree, not just against the edited manifest.
`@tiptap/suggestion` stays — it is the one code path both the `@` and `/` menus
register through, and the spec plans for it explicitly. `@tiptap/starter-kit`
also still has zero imports and remains a separate follow-up
(`progress.md:36`).

---

## 5. Protected-suite proof

The six suites named as protected must be **byte-identical** to base across the
whole plan.

```
$ git diff --stat 1fd281f897..HEAD -- '*composer-reset.test.ts' \
    '*composer-draft-recovery.test.ts' '*message-queue-boundary.test.ts' \
    '*queued-messages-logic.test.ts' '*model-availability.test.ts' \
    '*model-flatten.test.ts'
(no output)
```

Empty output alone would also be produced by a glob matching nothing, so the
files were confirmed to exist and their blob hashes compared directly:

| File | base blob | HEAD blob |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/web/src/features/session/composer-reset.test.ts` | `b0b33c28002d` | `b0b33c28002d` |
| `apps/web/src/features/session/composer-draft-recovery.test.ts` | `d97abe1e6465` | `d97abe1e6465` |
| `apps/web/src/features/session/message-queue-boundary.test.ts` | `b9aa841de61a` | `b9aa841de61a` |
| `apps/web/src/features/session/model-availability.test.ts` | `ee2fd387ca66` | `ee2fd387ca66` |
| `apps/web/src/features/session/model-flatten.test.ts` | `d15efbbbb487` | `d15efbbbb487` |
| `apps/web/src/features/session/composer/queued-messages-logic.test.ts` | `78e34729fe12` | `78e34729fe12` |

All six identical. **No protected contract moved.** The same command run against
this task's own working diff is likewise empty, and
`git diff -- '*.test.ts' '*.test.tsx' | grep -c '^-[^-]'` returns `0` — this task
removed no test line anywhere.

`git diff -- packages/sdk` and `git diff 1fd281f897..HEAD -- packages/sdk` are
both empty.

---

## 6. What remains unverified, and exactly what would verify it

Ordered by how much a defect there would cost.

1. **`composer.tsx`'s wiring has no test at all — this is the single largest
   gap on the branch, and it is why 17 rows are CODE-VERIFIED rather than
   PROVEN.** Nothing imports `composer/composer`. Every CODE-VERIFIED row above
   rests on reading the call site, not on a test protecting it. This is
   measured, not assumed: during Task 13 a reviewer replaced the whole
   failed-send recovery with `if (false && …)` and the suite stayed green at
   1340/1340.

   The fixes in this task narrow the gap without closing it. Rows 1 and 21 now
   have their *decision logic* in pure, fully-tested functions
   (`planPrefillMerge`, `appendTranscribedText`) whose output is additionally
   round-tripped through a real editor — so the call site is reduced to a few
   lines that pass values through. But nothing proves `composer.tsx` still
   calls them. Deleting the `handleTranscription` body would leave all 1394
   tests green.

   *Would verify it:* React Testing Library plus a DOM environment for
   `bun test`, or Playwright driving the real composer. Deliberately **not**
   attempted here — building that harness is its own piece of work, not a fix
   round, and doing it badly under time pressure would produce coverage that
   looks like proof and is not.
2. **`use-composer-focus.ts` has no test** — it carries rows 11, 12 and 13.
   *Would verify it:* a DOM environment with `IntersectionObserver` and layout,
   or a browser.
3. **Row 12's cold-load window.** A `focus-session-textarea` event arriving
   while the lazy editor chunk is still loading exhausts the 10-frame retry and
   is lost with no re-arm.
   *Would verify it:* Chromium, cache disabled and network throttled, open a
   session from the command palette, assert `document.activeElement` is the
   contenteditable; repeat warm as a control.
4. **Row 18's actual mobile impact.** Confirmed in code; the layout consequence
   of reverting is not.
   *Would verify it:* the session page at 375 px wide, with and without the
   `hidden sm:flex` wrapper, screenshotting the toolbar.
5. **Row 11's caret position after a raw `el.focus()`.** Whether ProseMirror's
   stored selection is still the user's pre-blur caret when `insertContent`
   runs is DOM timing.
   *Would verify it:* type a draft, click a transcript message, type a
   character, assert it lands at the previous caret.
6. **Row 7's paste focus round-trip.** ProseMirror's `capturePaste` performs a
   ~50 ms hidden-element focus dance on a files-only paste.
   *Would verify it:* paste an image into the composer and watch
   `document.activeElement` across the window.
7. **Row 6's drop over the contenteditable.** The propagation question is
   settled from `prosemirror-view` source (`preventDefault` only, never
   `stopPropagation`); the end-to-end interaction is not.
   *Would verify it:* `dragenter` on the card, a second on the editor, one
   `dragleave` from the editor — assert the overlay is still shown — then drop a
   `DataTransfer` with a file over the contenteditable and assert a tile appears
   with nothing inserted into the document.
8. **Row 3's amber placeholder colour** — a CSS `::before` rule on
   `p.is-editor-empty:first-child`. *Would verify it:* computed style of the
   pseudo-element while `lockForApproval` is true, in both themes.
9. **Row 14's narrowed first Escape.** `@tiptap/suggestion` swallows Escape
   whenever a trigger match is active, including with zero rows, where the old
   composer let it through to the stop counter. *Would verify it:* type `@zzzzz`
   while the agent is running and count the Escapes needed to stop.
10. **ARIA reachability** (`composer.tsx:619-706`). The `MutationObserver` that
    mirrors `aria-controls`/`aria-activedescendant` onto the contenteditable is
    inherently DOM-only. *Would verify it:* a screen reader, or asserting the
    two attributes on the contenteditable while a menu is open.

### One constraint note

The task constraint was "no new dependencies". Six `@tiptap/*` entries were
added to `apps/web/package.json` during the plan. Four
(`extension-bold`, `extension-code`, `extension-italic`, `extensions`) were
already resolved in `pnpm-lock.yaml` at base and are promotions of existing
transitives. **Only one is a genuinely new package** — `@tiptap/suggestion`
(absent from the base lockfile, pinned to `3.27.1`, along with `@tiptap/core`
and `@tiptap/pm` since `3.27.1` declares exact peers on both). It is
load-bearing: it is the single code path both the `@` and `/` menus register
through, and the spec plans for it explicitly (§4, "To add:
`@tiptap/suggestion`"). `@tiptap/extension-mention` was evaluated alongside
it, found to have **zero imports in `src/`** — the mention node is hand-built
in `composer/editor/mention-node.ts` — and **has already been dropped**
(Task 14; `apps/web/package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`), not merely a candidate
to drop. Separately, `@tiptap/starter-kit` also has zero imports and was
already noted for removal (`progress.md:36`).

## 7. Changes made by this task

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `composer/editor/serialize.ts` | `hardBreak` serializes to `'\n'` (row 10) |
| `composer/composer-logic.ts` | `textToParagraphs`/`textToDocument` moved here from `composer-editor.tsx`; `planPrefillMerge` (row 1); `appendTranscribedText` (row 21) |
| `composer/composer.tsx` | Merge-mode prefill routed through `planPrefillMerge` (row 1); `handleTranscription` rewritten (row 21); `tokenProgressWrapperClassName` call site removed (row 18); `editorDisabled` hoisted (deferred item 14) |
| `composer/composer-toolbar.tsx` | `tokenProgressWrapperClassName` prop and its dead branch removed; `TokenProgress` always visible (row 18) |
| `composer/editor/composer-editor.tsx` | Imports the shared `textToParagraphs` instead of defining its own |
| `composer/editor/composer-editor.test.ts` | +12 tests: row 10 through `serializeDocument`, plus rows 1 and 21 round-tripped through a real editor |
| `composer/composer-toolbar.test.tsx` | New — 3 SSR-rendered tests asserting nothing hides `TokenProgress` at any viewport (row 18) |
| `composer/token-progress.tsx` | `data-slot="token-progress"` — the repo-standard stable hook the row-18 test locates it by |
| `composer/composer-logic.test.ts` | +11 tests: `planPrefillMerge` and `appendTranscribedText` |
| `composer/hooks/use-file-search.ts` | Placeholder data restricted to the same sandbox (deferred item 4) |
| `composer/hooks/use-file-search.test.ts` | New — 8 tests for the placeholder guard and key shape |
| `apps/web/package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` | `@tiptap/extension-mention` removed |
| `docs/superpowers/specs/…-design.md` | Matrix rows 23 and 24 added |
| This document, `.superpowers/sdd/…/task-14-report.md` | Verification record and working notes |

Net: **1394 tests pass** (from 1360, all additive), tsc at the 15-error baseline
with none in `composer/`, eslint 3 warnings / 0 errors, `packages/sdk` zero
diff, protected suites byte-identical.

## 8. Measurements (Task 15)

Spec §6 sets five targets. This section reports what was actually measured on
this machine, on this branch, and states plainly which of the five could be
measured directly and which could only be source-verified — no browser and no
profiler session were available (standing project constraint). Full method,
commands and raw numbers: `.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-09-enhance-chat-input/task-15-report.md`.

**Correction (recorded, not hidden).** This section originally reported a
bundle cut (removing `Blockquote`/`Bold`/`Italic`/`Strike`/`Code`/`CodeBlock`/
`Link`/`BulletList`/`OrderedList`/`ListItem` from `extensions.ts`) as the
final state, bringing the delta to +102.9 KB gz. That cut has been
**reverted**. Markdown support — input rules while typing plus correct
serialization on send — is spec §2 Goal 4, an explicit user requirement
("we need to make this essential input markdown-friendly. Markdown should be
supported properly"), not a nice-to-have the compat matrix happened to omit.
The compat matrix protects against the rewrite silently *dropping* something
the old textarea composer had; markdown was never in the old composer, so its
absence from the matrix means the matrix cannot speak for it, not that it is
expendable. The 100 KB ceiling was an estimate written into the T15 brief
before this branch existed; a written requirement outranks an estimate. All
ten extensions are back, `@tiptap/starter-kit` (genuinely zero imports,
independent of markdown) stays removed.

| Target | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| React commits per keystroke: 1 → 0 | Source-verified | **0**, confirmed against installed `@tiptap/react` source (below) |
| Commits per 60 s idle, empty composer: 10 → 0 | Source-verified (grep) | **0** — no `setInterval` anywhere in `composer/` |
| `ModelSelector` renders per keystroke: 1 → 0 | Source-verified | **0** in steady state — boundary-only re-render, traced below |
| Composer chunk (gz), with markdown: baseline → ≤ baseline + 100 KB | **Measured**, real builds | **+136.0 KB gz — exceeds the 100 KB ceiling by ~36 KB. Open — see 8.2.** |
| Mention menu open → first paint: — → < 100 ms warm | Not measurable here | Requires a browser; not attempted |

### 8.1 Bundle — measured, not estimated

Turbopack's `next build` (Next 16.3.0) prints no per-route "First Load JS"
table and this repo has no bundle analyzer, so the delta was measured by
building the app twice from the same tree and isolating the one chunk that
carries the composer's TipTap/ProseMirror code.

**Sequence** (full commands and logs in the task-15 report):
1. Build HEAD (`d6cbb35de9`) with `next build`. Grep every
   `.next/static/chunks/*.js` for markers that can only come from the
   TipTap/ProseMirror stack (`prosemirror-`, `findSuggestionMatch`,
   `MentionNode`, `composer-editor`, `trackEmptyBoundary`,
   `serializeDocument`, `@tiptap`; two looser markers produced verified false
   positives — `.ProseMirror` as a CSS-class check, `hardBreak` as a markdown
   tokenizer name — and were discarded). Exactly one chunk matched:
   `2rrrqe1i85hsv.js`, raw 437,383 bytes, **gz 136,028 bytes**.
2. `git stash -u`, `git checkout 1fd281f897 -- apps/web`, confirm the old
   `session-chat-input.tsx` has zero `tiptap` references
   (`grep -c tiptap` → 0), `rm -rf .next`, rebuild. Same marker sweep: **zero**
   matching chunks. (The only hit under a looser `data-mention` marker was
   the old `mention-popover.tsx`'s unrelated `data-mention-index` attribute.)
   Baseline confirmed as a real, verified 0, not assumed.
3. Restore HEAD (`git checkout HEAD -- apps/web` + remove the 3 paths HEAD
   deleted that a path-scoped checkout doesn't remove on its own); confirm
   `git diff HEAD -- apps/web` is empty.

Delta with markdown, no cut: **+136.0 KB gz — over the 100 KB ceiling by
~36 KB.**

**Caveat — this measurement may under-count, not over-count.** The chunk was
identified by grepping emitted chunks for string markers, and most of those
markers (`prosemirror-`, `@tiptap`, and similar) are import specifiers —
Turbopack rewrites them away during bundling, so a marker like this only
survives in a chunk if the literal string also appears in run-time code (an
error message, a package's own internal string). The one marker discarded
above that would actually catch a *view-only* chunk — `.ProseMirror`, the CSS
class ProseMirror stamps onto its DOM, which survives bundling because it is
a real class name, not an import path — was ruled a false positive without
recording which chunk it matched or how large that chunk was. "Exactly one
chunk matched" (step 1 above) is an observation about which chunks contain
the specific import-specifier markers grepped for, not proof that the entire
TipTap/ProseMirror surface — including any view/render code Turbopack split
into a separate chunk that happens not to contain those particular literals —
lives in that one chunk. **+136.0 KB gz should be read as a floor, not a
verified exact total**: it is everything the marker sweep could find, and the
sweep had a known, undocumented gap.

### 8.2 The cut that was tried, reverted, and why — open decision for the user

Per the original T15 brief, a bundle cut was attempted: `Blockquote`,
`Bold`, `Italic`, `Strike`, `Code`, `CodeBlock`, `Link`,
`BulletList`/`OrderedList`/`ListItem` removed from `extensions.ts`,
re-measured at **+102.9 KB gz** (−24.3%, still ~2.9 KB over the ceiling), and
committed. **That commit has been reverted.** The cut's own reasoning — no
compat-matrix row references these extensions, no test names them — was
correct on its own terms, but the compat matrix was never the whole spec.
Markdown support is spec §2 Goal 4, stated directly by the user, and every
one of the ten cut extensions is part of that surface (bold/italic/strike/
code-span/code-block/link/lists/blockquote are exactly the marks and nodes
markdown input rules and serialization need). Cutting them for bundle budget
would have shipped the branch without a stated requirement to hit an
estimate. The estimate was wrong, not the requirement.

**All ten extensions are restored, byte-for-byte.** `extensions.ts` and
`composer.tsx` are back to their pre-cut content (`git diff d6cbb35de9 --
extensions.ts composer.tsx` is empty). The restore was done carefully: a
first attempt re-added the eight package.json entries as fresh dependency
specifiers, which caused `pnpm install` to re-resolve them against the
registry — `^3`/`^3.14.0` ranges that had been pinned at `3.27.1` in the
lockfile drifted to `3.29.2`, a real, unintended version bump (caught by
diffing the resulting `pnpm-lock.yaml` against the pre-cut one). That attempt
was discarded. The correct restore: `git checkout d6cbb35de9 --
apps/web/package.json pnpm-lock.yaml` (byte-identical to the original,
confirmed by diff), then remove only the `@tiptap/starter-kit` line and
re-run `pnpm install`. The resulting lockfile diff against the original is
minimal and exact: the `starter-kit` entry plus its four
transitive-only-through-starter-kit dependencies
(`extension-bullet-list`, `extension-list-item`, `extension-list-keymap`,
`extension-ordered-list`) — nothing else moves. Rebuilding on this lockfile
reproduced the composer chunk **byte-for-byte identical** to the original
pre-cut measurement (`diff` on the two `.js` files: no output), which is the
strongest possible confirmation that removing `starter-kit` costs nothing and
that the restore is genuine, not approximate.

`@tiptap/starter-kit` stays removed — confirmed zero real imports anywhere in
`apps/web/src` (checked by symbol, `grep -rn "StarterKit"`, not by import
path) both before the original cut and again after the revert, and it is
orthogonal to markdown (nothing in `composer/` ever imported it; the mention
node and markdown formatting are hand-assembled from individual `@tiptap/
extension-*` packages, not the starter bundle).

**Gates after the full restore:** `bun test src/features/session` → 1394
pass, 0 fail (unchanged). `npx eslint src/features/session/composer/` → 3
warnings, 0 errors (unchanged). `npx tsc --noEmit` → 15 errors, none in
`composer/` (unchanged). `git diff --stat -- packages/sdk` → empty.

**The honest trade-off, left open:**

| | Composer chunk (gz) | vs. 100 KB ceiling |
|---|---:|---|
| With markdown (required, spec §2 Goal 4) | **136.0 KB** | **+36 KB over** |
| Without markdown (reverted; not shippable as final state) | 102.9 KB | +2.9 KB over |

**The 100 KB ceiling was never achievable with ProseMirror plus the `@`/`/`
menu system at all — even the maximal cut only reached 102.9 KB, still over
budget.** The figure was an estimate written into the plan before any of
this existed. This measurement falsifies it. That is a useful finding, not a
failure of this task: closing the ~36 KB gap means either the user raises
the budget, or the user drops the markdown requirement — **that decision
belongs to the user, not to this task**, and is left open rather than
resolved here.

**What 136.0 KB gz buys, for the reader to weigh against the cost:** the
ProseMirror editing engine, atomic mention badges that survive edits and
merges as single units, the `@` and `/` menus (Tasks 6–8's actual
deliverable, covering matrix rows 8, 9, 23, 24), markdown input rules and
correct send-time serialization (spec §2 Goal 4), and the uncontrolled-editor
architecture that removed per-keystroke React re-rendering across
`ModelSelector`/`AgentSelector`/`VariantSelector`/`ReasoningEffortSelector`/
`TokenProgress`/`VoiceRecorder` (§8.3 below) — a target this plan could not
have hit with a controlled `<textarea>` + React state at all.

**Real-world context, not a mitigation:** this chunk is **lazy-loaded**
(`React.lazy()`, `composer.tsx:281`) — it is not part of the initial route
paint. It loads when `ComposerEditorLazy`'s `Suspense` boundary first
resolves (session/project pages that render the composer), not on every page
in the app, and not before first paint on the pages that do. This changes
*when* the cost is paid, not *whether* it is paid — 136 KB gz is still real
transfer and parse cost for anyone who opens a composer, stated here as
context for judging the number, not as a reason the ceiling doesn't apply.

**Caveat — "lazy-loaded" is not "opt-in."** "Not part of the initial route
paint" is literally true and should not be read as "most users never pay this
cost." The composer mounts **eagerly on hydration**, with no click, focus, or
other user action gating it: `ComposerChatInput` is imported and rendered
unconditionally in the project-home welcome body
(`project-home.tsx:33` import, `:204` render — every project page before a
session exists), in the instant-session shell
(`instant-session-shell.tsx:7` import, `:187` render — the first-message
flow), and `Composer` (aliased `SessionChatInput`) is rendered unconditionally
for every non-read-only session in `session-chat.tsx:53` (import), `:3925`
(render, gated only on `!readOnly`, which is the normal case). So the
`Suspense` boundary resolves, and the 136 KB gz chunk downloads and parses, on
essentially every project or session page view — not only for a user who
deliberately "engages the composer." The lazy boundary saves this cost from
landing on pages that never render a composer at all (marketing pages,
settings, etc.); it does not save it for the product's own core surfaces.

### 8.3 Render metrics — source-verified against installed code

`@tiptap/react@3.27.1` (`dist/index.cjs:536-556`, `useEditor`) builds a
selector that returns a **constant `null`** on every transaction unless
`shouldRerenderOnTransaction` is explicitly set:

```js
selector: ({ transactionNumber }) => {
  if (options.shouldRerenderOnTransaction === false || options.shouldRerenderOnTransaction === void 0) {
    return null;
  }
  ...
}
```

`composer/editor/composer-editor.tsx:386` calls `useEditor({...})` with no
`shouldRerenderOnTransaction` key (grep confirms it appears nowhere in
`composer/`). `useEditorState`'s `useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector` compares
that constant `null` with `fast-equals`' `deepEqual` on every keystroke —
`null === null` — so React never re-renders `ComposerEditor` (or anything
above it) from typing alone. This is the mechanism, verified against the
installed `.cjs`, not taken from prose.

**Boundary-only propagation, traced end to end:** `trackEmptyBoundary`
(`composer-editor.tsx:147`) wraps `onUpdate` and calls its callback only when
`editor.isEmpty` flips (`:372-374,433`). `composer.tsx:403`'s
`[isEmpty, setIsEmpty]` is that callback (`:1253`
`onEmptyChange={setIsEmpty}`) — the only setState this path can trigger, and
only on the empty↔non-empty boundary. `hasText={!isEmpty}`
(`composer.tsx:1309`) is the one prop `ComposerToolbar` gets that changes
from typing, and it feeds every child listed in the target —
`ModelSelector`, `AgentSelector`, `VariantSelector`,
`ReasoningEffortSelector`, `TokenProgress`, `VoiceRecorder`,
`SendStopControl`. So these re-render on an empty↔non-empty crossing (twice
per typical typing session), not once per keystroke — 0 renders per
keystroke in steady state, matching the target.

**Idle metric:** `grep -rn "setInterval" composer/` — zero hits anywhere in
the directory. The old 6-second rotating-placeholder timer (the "10 commits
per 60s idle" driver) has no equivalent; `Placeholder`'s decoration only
recomputes on a transaction, and there are none at rest.

**What a profiler run would add that this doesn't:** confirmation that no
`React.memo`/prop-identity boundary around `ModelSelector` etc. is
force-rerendered by something unrelated (a sibling's state, a context
change), and a literal DevTools commit count rather than a traced
subscribe/notify mechanism. The trace above is sufficient to rule out
re-rendering *from typing*, which is what the target measures — but it is
source-tracing, not a live capture, and is reported as such.

### 8.4 What this branch actually changed — numbers, all by command

**Tests**, `bun test src/features/session`, both ends checked out clean (not
the mid-plan "1360" checkpoint Task 14 logged internally, which was its own
pre/post fix-round delta, not the whole-branch before):

| | pass | fail | files |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Before (`1fd281f897`) | 1177 | 0 | 102 |
| After (with markdown restored) | 1394 | 0 | 121 |
| Net | **+217** | — | **+19** |

**ESLint**, `npx eslint src/features/session/composer/`: **7 warnings, 0
errors → 3 warnings, 0 errors.**

**tsc**, `npx tsc --noEmit`: **15 errors → 15 errors**, unchanged, none in
`composer/` on either end.

**Net line delta**, `git diff --stat 1fd281f897 <tree>`:
- Full scope (apps/web + lockfile + docs): **61 files, +10072 / −1993**
  (includes this section's own growth — a moving target as the document is
  edited, not a source code figure)
- Composer + `session-chat-input.tsx` only, source only: **46 files, +7206 /
  −1863** — unchanged from Task 14's own count, because `extensions.ts` and
  `composer.tsx` are back to byte-identical with the pre-cut state.

**Dependencies, net, branch-point → final:** **+4.** Added
`@tiptap/extension-bold`, `-code`, `-italic`, `@tiptap/extensions`,
`@tiptap/suggestion` (+5, all genuinely new to this branch, all required —
`-bold`/`-code`/`-italic` are part of the markdown formatting set, kept);
removed `@tiptap/starter-kit` (−1, present at the branch point, confirmed
zero real imports both before Task 15's revert and after, unrelated to
markdown). (`@tiptap/extension-mention`, added mid-plan and removed by Task
14, nets to zero and isn't counted again here.)
