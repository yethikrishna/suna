# Smooth shadow source audit

**Date:** 2026-08-06
**Scope:** `apps/web/src`
**Baseline:** `897f7acf6d`
**Inventory command:** `rg -n --glob '*.{ts,tsx,css}' 'shadow(-|\[|\b)|box-shadow|boxShadow' apps/web/src`

## Policy

- Standard elevated surface: `shadow-sm`, `shadow-md`, or `shadow-lg`; no decorative full border or `ring-1`.
- Structural edge: directional border plus explicit ringless `smooth-shadow-*`.
- Semantic state: explicit smooth color or CSS outline; never sacrifice focus or status.
- In-flow surface: flat unless elevation communicates stacking.
- Media: preserve `drop-shadow-*`; use ringless smooth depth for opaque media.

## Inventory summary

The approved design recorded 107 matching files and 43 files with native
`shadow-sm`, `shadow-md`, or `shadow-lg`. After adding the compile contract,
the current tree contains 110 matching files and 45 standard-alias files when
tests are included.

Excluding `*.test.*`, the pre-migration production inventory contains:

| Measure                                             | Count |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----: |
| Files with any shadow source                        |    99 |
| Lines with any shadow source                        |   210 |
| Files with `shadow-sm`, `shadow-md`, or `shadow-lg` |    41 |
| Lines with `shadow-sm`, `shadow-md`, or `shadow-lg` |    73 |

The source-policy red test found 36 decorative double-edge literals. This is
the migration baseline for Tasks 4–7.

Six legacy `shadow-custom` tokens across five files emitted no CSS. The
migration removes these no-op classes instead of assigning unearned elevation.

## Standard alias migration

Negative assertions in `get-mem-tool.test.tsx` and
`memory-search-tool.test.tsx` remain unchanged. They verify that in-flow memory
results stay flat.

## Explicit utilities retained

The following non-standard uses were reviewed before migration.

### Structural or compact control depth

- `components/ui/button-group.tsx`
- `components/ui/button.tsx`
- `components/ui/checkbox.tsx`
- `components/ui/command.tsx`
- `components/ui/input-group.tsx`
- `components/ui/radio-group.tsx`
- `components/ui/scroll-area.tsx`
- `components/ui/slider-native.tsx`
- `components/ui/slider.tsx`
- `components/ui/trigger-variants.ts`
- `components/home/interactive-demo-section.tsx`
- `components/home/interactive-demo/primitives.tsx`
- `features/file-renderers/shared/document-viewer-sidebar.tsx`
- `features/file-renderers/shared/scroll-area-compat.tsx`
- `features/session/action-panel/shared/action-navigator.tsx`

Native `shadow-xs` and inset or arbitrary shadows in this group are compact
component details. They do not use the three standard elevated-surface aliases.

### Explicit elevated surfaces

- `app/(system)/debug/connecting/page.tsx`
- `components/home/interactive-demo/cli/draggable-cli-panel.tsx`
- `components/ui/chart.tsx`
- `components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx`
- `components/ui/sidebar.tsx`
- `features/file-viewer/file-preview-modal.tsx`
- `features/session/action-panel/easy/panel-card.tsx`
- `features/session/session-chat.tsx`
- `features/session/tool/shared/infrastructure.tsx`

Existing `shadow-xl`, `shadow-2xl`, and reviewed arbitrary stacks in this group
represent non-standard floating windows, debug surfaces, or compatibility
layers. New changes use the plugin's explicit sizes where a migrated standard
alias would otherwise stack with them.

### Semantic state or focus treatment

- `components/file-editors/codemirror-diagnostics.ts`
- `components/ui/emoji-picker.tsx`
- `components/ui/entity-avatar.tsx`
- `components/ui/glyph-picker.tsx`
- `components/ui/tabs.tsx`
- `features/projects/modal/project-icon-field.tsx`

These shadows or `boxShadow` values communicate focus, diagnostics, selection,
or color state. The migration does not remove the state. Where a standard
alias shares the element, the state moves to an outline or smooth-ring color.

### Media and marketing treatment

- `components/blog/blog-cover.tsx`
- `components/referrals/referral-email-invitation.tsx`
- `components/ui/marketing/button.tsx`
- `features/billing/pricing-plan-card.tsx`
- `features/file-renderers/csv/csv-viewer.tsx`
- `features/file-renderers/docx/docx-viewer.tsx`
- `features/file-renderers/pdf/pdf-viewer.tsx`
- `features/file-renderers/xlsx/xlsx-viewer.tsx`
- `features/marketing/landing/use-case-wheel.tsx`
- `features/project-files/components/drive-explorer.tsx`
- `features/project-files/components/drive-grid-view.tsx`
- `features/project-files/components/file-explorer-page.tsx`
- `features/project-files/components/file-search.tsx`

`drop-shadow-*` remains unchanged because it follows alpha. Image, document,
and marketing-frame box shadows remain explicit only where their edge is not a
standard application overlay.

### Contract and documentation sources

- `app/globals.css`
- `app/(public)/(marketing)/design-system/page.tsx`
- `components/ui/emoji-picker.test.tsx`
- `components/ui/entity-avatar.test.tsx`
- `features/projects/modal/project-icon-field.test.tsx`

These files define or test the design system. They are not additional runtime
elevation owners.
