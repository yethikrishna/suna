/**
 * `pi-js.kortix.com` — the stable front door for the JS pi agent
 * (apps/pi-worker-js) running as a Platinum Worker cell on Platinum DEV.
 *
 * Same job as pi-router for pi.kortix.com: the cell's own origin
 * (`8080-<cell>.eu-west.sbx-dev.platinum.dev`) is derived from its sandbox id,
 * survives stop/start (the cell scales to zero and cold-boots on the next
 * request) but not a delete + recreate, and is unmemorable either way. The
 * Platinum edge routes by HOSTNAME, so a proxied CNAME cannot carry the name;
 * a Worker rebuilds the request against the target origin.
 *
 * Two things pi-router does not do, because the JS agent has no auth of its
 * own (a request names a session with `?c=` and gets an agent with shell
 * tools):
 *   1. The cell's port is NOT public on the Platinum edge. The edge wants the
 *      exposure token (`?t=` or `x-pt-preview-token`); this Worker injects it
 *      from the PT_PREVIEW_TOKEN secret, so the token never reaches a browser.
 *   2. The name FAILS CLOSED. With ACCESS_TOKEN set, every request must carry
 *      `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>` or `x-kortix-access: <ACCESS_TOKEN>`
 *      (consumed here, never forwarded). With no ACCESS_TOKEN the Worker answers
 *      503 — unless the operator deployed with the plain var OPEN_ACCESS=true,
 *      which is pi.kortix.com parity stated out loud in the deploy, not a
 *      default a cleared secret can fall into (Strix review of #7125, CWE-306).
 *
 * The upstream URL is built from the TARGET origin and then given the incoming
 * path and query — never by resolving the incoming path against the origin. A
 * path that starts with `//` is a scheme-relative reference, and
 * `new URL('//evil/x', target)` would send the request — with the exposure
 * token attached — to evil. Such paths are refused with 400 (CWE-918).
 *
 * WebSocket upgrades pass through untouched (the agent streams turn events over
 * a socket); SSE/streaming bodies are piped, not buffered.
