# Kortix Infrastructure (Terraform)

Infrastructure-as-code for the Kortix API hosting. Each environment is a
separate root module under `environments/` with its own state.

> ⚠️ **Current runtime (2026-06-21):** prod = **EKS `kortix-prod-eks` (eu-west-2/London)**
> active; dev = **EKS `kortix-dev-eks` (us-west-2)** active. The **ECS Fargate stacks
> (`environments/{prod,dev}`) are the WARM STANDBY** the Cloudflare Worker fails over
> to — **NOT legacy, do not delete them.** Logs live in **Better Stack, not CloudWatch**.
> See **`infra/OBSERVABILITY.md`** for the full topology, the log tables, and the ECS
> standby restore runbook. (The env comments below are historical.)

## Current topology

Dev and prod public API traffic are fronted by Cloudflare Workers and route to
EKS (`X-Backend: eks` on `/v1/health`, verified 2026-06-21). The ECS Fargate
environment modules remain in Terraform as warm standby origins for the Worker;
they are not legacy Lightsail adoption code and should not be deleted just
because EKS is active.

## State

Most state lives in S3 (`kortix-terraform-state`) with a DynamoDB lock table
(`kortix-terraform-locks`), both in `us-west-2`.

The US East 2 production shadow uses the regional S3 bucket
`kortix-terraform-state-us-east-2-935064898258` and DynamoDB table
`kortix-terraform-locks-us-east-2`. See each root's `backend.tf`.
Bootstrap once with `bash scripts/bootstrap-state.sh` (creates the bucket +
table if absent), then `terraform init`.

## Usage

```bash
cd infra/terraform/environments/dev
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply     # only after a clean plan
```

## What is NOT in Terraform (yet)

- **Cloudflare DNS / Worker plain-text vars** — some records and Worker vars are
  still operationally managed outside Terraform; verify live `X-Backend` before
  redeploying Worker defaults (see `infra/cloudflare/workers/api-router`).
- **Hosted frontend** (`dev.kortix.com`, `kortix.com`) — managed by Vercel's own
  GitHub integration, not Terraform.
