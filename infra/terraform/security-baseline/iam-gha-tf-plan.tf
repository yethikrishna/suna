# kortix-gha-tf-plan — the OIDC role the scheduled drift-detection job assumes
# (terraform-ci.yml, job "drift detection").
#
# WHY: the job has been gated on the repo variable TF_PLAN_ROLE_ARN since it
# was written, and that variable never existed — so it resolved to "skipping",
# which renders green in the checks list. A change-management control that has
# never executed is worse than no control, because the dashboard says it ran.
#
# SCOPE: `terraform plan` has to read every resource a root manages, so this is
# necessarily account-wide read. It is read-only (ReadOnlyAccess) and the
# inline policy then subtracts the parts of "read" that are really data
# exfiltration: secret values, parameter decryption, and KMS decrypt. Plan does
# not need any of them — no drift-matrix root reads a secret at plan time, and
# the state bucket is SSE-S3 (AES256), so state access does not touch KMS.
#
# The job runs with -lock=false, so no DynamoDB write is required.
