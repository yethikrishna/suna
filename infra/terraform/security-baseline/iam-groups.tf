# MFA enforcement — the DENY side of the DCF-67 control. aws_iam_policy
# .mfa_self_manage above lets a user ENROLL an MFA device; this policy DENIES
# every action when the caller has NOT authenticated with MFA. Drata DCF-67
# (testId 88 "MFA on Cloud Infrastructure") checks that MFA is actually
# ENFORCED, not merely available — without a Deny, a user with no MFA device
# (e.g. `ino` today) can still act on every permitted resource, which is what
# the resource-level failure flagged.
#
# Standard AWS MFA-enforcement pattern: Effect = Deny, NotAction = the MFA +
# password + GetSessionToken self-enrollment surface (so a user without MFA
# can still enroll their first device and mint an MFA'd session), Condition
# BoolIfExists { aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent = false }. BoolIfExists (not Bool)
# is deliberate: an unauthenticated STS GetSessionToken call carries no MFA
# context at all, and BoolIfExists treats a missing key the same as false, so
# the deny fires for both "MFA present but false" and "MFA context absent".
#
# Resource MUST be "*" — this is a deny-all-except-enrollment, so it cannot be
# scoped to a resource ARN. The Drata Compliance-as-Code scanner (testId 8025
# "Access Policies Restrict Broad Access") only flags `Resource: "*"` on
# `Effect: "Allow"` statements (a broad allow); this `Effect: "Deny"` is the
# opposite and is NOT flagged — verified on PR #6289 (scan
# 0c4a4878-9b23-4751-a7d0-84d68c6b0050: critical count unchanged from main).
# The wildcard use is recorded in docs/compliance/IAC-SCANNER-EXCEPTIONS.md
# under "Not-flagged wildcard policies" so a future scanner change is caught
# against an explicit baseline. The checkov skip is defensive — checkov runs
# soft_fail: true in CI so it does not gate, but the comment documents intent.
