/**
 * Pool + timeout defaults for the postgres.js client.
 *
 * Why these exist (prod incident, 2026-06-08): the client used to be created
 * with *no* limits — postgres.js then defaults to `max: 10` per process and
 * **no statement/connect/idle timeouts**. With 2 prod replicas that is only ~20
 * DB connections for the entire fleet, and postgres.js has **no acquire/queue
 * timeout**: once every connection is busy, further queries queue *forever*
 * until the caller gives up. A single stuck query therefore pinned a connection
 * indefinitely and cascaded into fleet-wide "Request timed out after 30s" on
 * completely unrelated endpoints (sandbox-health, secrets, change-requests,
 * iam/effective, …) — because they were all just waiting for a free connection.
 *
 * The fix has two parts:
 *   1. `statement_timeout` — the key anti-cascade lever. Caps how long any
 *      single statement (and thus a checked-out connection) can run, so a stuck
 *      query frees its slot and the queue drains instead of hanging the fleet.
 *      (Investigation found real offenders: an unindexed 21M-row audit scan at
 *      80–120s, and account-deletion sweeps at 36–64s, each pinning a connection
 *      for up to the 2-min server statement_timeout.)
 *   2. An env-tunable `max` so normal concurrent page loads can run without
 *      letting a rolling deployment exhaust the PostgreSQL server.
 *
 * SIZING: prod connects DIRECTLY to Postgres (db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432), NOT
 * the Supavisor pooler. Every client connection consumes one real backend.
 * PostgreSQL exposes 237 non-reserved slots. ECS can overlap 10 old tasks and
 * 10 new tasks during a rolling deployment. The API also owns an audit pool,
 * a leader-election connection, and a transient startup schema probe. The
 * capacity invariant in apps/api/src/shared/database-capacity.test.ts accounts
 * for all four sources and preserves a non-API reserve. If replica count or
 * pool size grows, update that invariant before changing this default.
 *
 * All knobs are env-overridable so prod can tune without a code change. The
 * app's background workers (maintenance sweeps, migration workers) only ever run
 * small batched/indexed statements, so the 25s cap is safe for them; if a future
 * job needs a longer single statement it should `SET LOCAL statement_timeout`
 * inside its own transaction rather than raising this request-path default.
