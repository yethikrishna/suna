 * beating downstream immediately and waits out the real work under the (much
 * larger) INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS gap budget. The only thing this bound costs is
 * the ability to fail over to another candidate, which is the correct trade —
 * a slow candidate is not a broken one.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT SIZE-SCALED ANY MORE. It used to be
 * `30_000 + ceil((requestBytes - 64KiB) / 1MiB) * 15_000`, capped at 120_000.
 * Any request body between 3,211,776 and 4,259,840 bytes therefore resolved to
 * exactly 90,000 — and a Claude Fable 5 turn on a ~3.5MiB context routinely
 * spends longer than that in prefill + thinking before its first reasoning
 * delta, because the transport emits no bytes for the AI SDK's `start` /
 * `start-step` parts. The result was a deterministic, repeating
 * `upstream stream probe timeout exceeded (90000ms with no bytes)` on a
 * perfectly healthy upstream: the bigger the context, the longer the model
 * needs, and the ladder handed it a bigger budget while the model needed a
 * bigger one still. Scaling the budget could only ever move the cliff; it
 * could not remove it. Committing instead of failing removes it.
 *
 * It must also stay well under the downstream first-byte deadline: nothing has
 * been written to the client yet while the probe runs, and the edge will serve
 * a 524 if the origin takes too long to respond. Measured on the live
 * kortix.com zone (2026-08-16): `proxy_read_timeout = 125` seconds, and
 * `editable: false` on the Free plan, so it cannot be raised. 30s leaves ~95s
 * of headroom. Raising this budget past ~125s cannot work — the client would
 * get a Cloudflare 524 before the gateway ever reached its own deadline.
