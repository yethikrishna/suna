 * ANY account-scope action outright for a project-bound token — BEFORE the

 * curation/UX surface (what the CLI/dashboard editor OFFER as grantable, and
 * what `validateGrantList` flags as a bad `kortix_cli` entry), not the
 * security boundary itself — grant-omission alone would not stop a
 * hypothetical non-project-scoped token from calling an account action.
