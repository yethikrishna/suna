 * could never deploy, and the author found out from a failed deploy instead of

 * validated clean and failed at deploy, and the App that eventually shipped
 * without those variables did not error at all — the feature depending on them
 * simply rendered nothing.
 *
 * So the rule lives here, in the contract package both sides already depend
