# The Kortix Marketplace — philosophy & production architecture

This is the "why" behind `@kortix/registry`. It defines what a production-grade
Kortix marketplace *is*, the invariants it must never break, and the decisions
that make it safe to let strangers publish things other people install.

> One-line thesis: **Git hosts the goods, the lock is the truth, Kortix is the
> index — and nothing installs without the user seeing exactly what it does.**

The north star is **Go modules / Homebrew taps / GitHub Actions**, not npm. In
those systems the *source repo* is the unit of distribution, you pin by ref, the
contents are content-hashed, and the central service is an *index + checksum
authority* — not a file host. That model is decentralized, tamper-evident, and
cheap to run. npm's centralized tarball host is the thing we deliberately avoid
becoming.

---

## Part 1 — First principles (the seven invariants)

Everything below derives from these. If a feature violates one, it's wrong.

1. **Git is the registry; Kortix is the index.** Items live in their authors'
   GitHub repos. The marketplace stores *metadata and trust signals*, never the
   files. This keeps us decentralized, removes us as a supply-chain bottleneck,
   and means the gallery is a thin catalog over the exact registries the CLI
   already installs from.

2. **One primitive.** A skill, agent, command, tool, trigger, connector, file,
   folder, rules doc, or whole project are the *same shape* — a registry item
   with a `type` and a list of `files` with `target`s. Bundles are just items
   whose payload is `registryDependencies`. Build the engine once; everything
   rides it.

3. **Install is a commit, not a side effect.** `kortix marketplace install`
   writes files into the project's repo and they get committed. No hidden runtime state, no
   service you depend on at runtime. The result is **diffable, reviewable,
   reversible (`git revert`), and self-contained.** This is the shadcn ethic:
   you own the source after install.

4. **The lock is the truth.** `registry-lock.json` records, per installed item,
   the source address *and a content hash of every file*. "What you have" is
   defined by the lock, not by a version string a publisher can lie about.
   Reproducible, tamper-evident, drift-detectable.

5. **Source over binary.** We distribute readable files (SKILL.md, .ts tools),
   never opaque blobs. Auditable before and after install. A reviewer — human or
   model — can read exactly what a skill will tell the agent to do.

6. **Progressive trust, least privilege.** Three rings — *your repo* (you typed
   the address), *your company* (org-trusted), *the world* (curated/verified).
   Capability and review requirements tighten as the blast radius widens.

7. **Consent before capability.** An item *declares* what it needs (secrets,
   connectors, network, tools) and the user *approves* that at install. No skill
   silently gains access to a secret or a connector. (Part 5.)

## Part 2 — Three layers (this resolves "should the core be registry-managed?")

Not everything should be a marketplace install. There are three concentric
layers, and the core belongs to the inner two.

```
┌─ Layer 3: MARKETPLACE ─ everyone's registries ─ marketplace install item ───┐
│  optional, opt-in, the 64 GKW skills + community skills/agents/bundles       │
│ ┌─ Layer 2: STANDARD LIBRARY ─ first-party @kortix/* registry ─────────────┐ │
│ │  official, curated, updatable: the Kortix-managed runtime skills + packs │ │
│ │ ┌─ Layer 1: RUNTIME FLOOR ─ baked into the starter scaffold ───────────┐ │ │
│ │ │  kortix-system, kortix-memory, executor/slack/computer, agent-browser │ │ │
│ │ │  them with ZERO network. A project must boot before any registry.    │ │ │
│ │ └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ │
│ └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Layer 1 (Runtime floor):** the absolute minimum every project must have to
  function. **Baked into the starter, installed offline by `kortix init`.** It
  must never require a live registry — otherwise project creation depends on a
  service being up. The sandbox image also carries the deployed managed copy.
  At boot, the daemon injects that copy into the OpenCode skill discovery path.
- **Layer 2 (Standard library):** the official `@kortix/*` registry. The core
  *is also published here* so an existing project can **update** it
  through the managed update workflow and so the same files have a single
  canonical source. Baked for bootstrap, marketplace-addressable for updates.
  Both, not either.
- **Layer 3 (Marketplace):** everyone else. Opt-in, curated at the global tier.

**Verdict:** the core is *registry-addressable* (Layer 2) but *scaffold-delivered*
(Layer 1). You don't force the floor through the network. "Everything is a
registry item" is true as a *data model*; it is not true as a *delivery
requirement*.

### Current Kortix-managed contract

The current Kortix-managed set is intentionally small:

- `kortix-system`
- `kortix-memory`
- `kortix-executor`
- `kortix-slack`
- `kortix-computer`

These are first-party runtime skills. They are baked into the starter so a new
project boots with no marketplace/network dependency, and they are also exposed
as marketplace items so existing projects can be inspected and updated through
the same install/update machinery.

Not Kortix-managed today:

- Default agents (`kortix`, `memory-reflector`)
- `agent-browser`
- OpenCode config files (`opencode.jsonc`, `package.json`, `bun.lock`)
- PTY/tools (`show`, `memory`, `web_search`, `scrape_webpage`, `image_search`)
- General Knowledge Worker skills

Those may be in the starter floor, but they do not carry `managedBy: "kortix"`
or `updatePolicy: "kortix-managed"` until the update workflow owns them.

### Kortix-managed update policy

The deployed system-skill overlay and project-owned files use separate update
paths.

1. The daemon overlays host-managed system skills at sandbox boot. This gives
   every OpenCode session instructions that match the deployed API and CLI.
2. `kortix system-skills get <name> --full` retrieves the same deployed source
   through the authenticated API.
3. Project-owned or optional marketplace files remain git state. Updates to
   those files use a normal branch, commit, and change request.
4. Runtime injection does not rewrite the checked-out repository or create a
   commit.

This split keeps platform instructions current while preserving project-owned
configuration as reviewable git state.

## Part 3 — The object model

**Item.** The atom. `name`, `type`, `files[]` (`path` → `target`), plus
`registryDependencies`, `envVars`, `categories`, `meta`. Identity within a
registry is `name`; globally it's `registry-namespace + name`.

**Registry.** A repo with a `registry.json` (or a JSON endpoint). Composable via
`include`. Namespaced (`@kortix`, `@acme`).

**Versioning — lean on git, pin by hash.** A "version" is a **git ref**
(branch / tag / sha). A "release" is a tag (`@v1.2.0`). Integrity is the
**content hash** in the lock (like `go.sum`, not like an npm version string).
Rules:
- Unpinned install (`owner/repo/item`) resolves the default branch *now* and
  **pins the resolved sha + hash in the lock**. Reproducible thereafter.
- Pinned install (`owner/repo@v1/item`) is explicit and stable.
- `kortix update <item>` re-resolves the ref → new hash → **shows a diff** →
  applies on confirm. Updates are visible commits, never silent.
- A publisher *may* set `meta.version` for display, but it is **never** the
  integrity source — the hash is.

**Dependencies.** `registryDependencies` form a DAG resolved transitively and
deduped (already implemented). Cross-registry deps use full addresses. A bundle
is an item that is *only* dependencies — the unit of "install a whole use-case."

**Deprecation & yank.** `meta.deprecated: "reason / successor"` shows a warning
on install/list. A **yank** (security) is an index-side flag that makes the
gallery refuse to surface it and `kortix marketplace install` warn loudly — but because files
live in the author's repo, yanking is *advisory at the source*, *enforced at the
index*. (Another reason index-not-host is honest: we can de-list, not rewrite
history we don't own.)

---

## Part 4 — Distribution & resolution

**Addressing** (already built): `owner/repo[@ref]/item`, `@ns/item`,
`./local#item`, `https://host/r/item.json`, bare `item` (against a default).

**Index, don't host (the central decision).** The global marketplace is a
**catalog of registries + a checksum/trust authority**, modeled on Go's
proxy + `sum.golang.org`:
- Authors **submit a repo URL**; Kortix crawls + validates its `registry.json`,
  denormalizes the items into a searchable index, and records a checksum.
- The gallery's "Add to project" runs the **same install** the CLI does, from
  the **author's repo**. Kortix never re-hosts the files.
- Optional **read-through proxy/cache** (like Go's GOPROXY) for availability +
  to survive an author deleting a repo — cache is keyed by hash, so it can't
  serve different bytes than what was indexed.

**Private & company registries.** Public GitHub registries resolve over raw
URLs. Private/company repos resolve through the **existing Kortix git-proxy**
(`/v1/git/:projectId/*`), which authorizes with the caller's Kortix token and
mints short-lived host credentials server-side — the real GitHub token never
reaches the client. This is the piece plain shadcn *can't* do and our biggest
structural advantage: **auth'd, private, company-scoped registries for free.**

**Caching.** Resolve results (registry.json, item JSON, file bytes) are cached
by `(source, sha)`. Immutable once pinned. Cheap.

---

## Part 5 — Trust, safety, supply chain (the production heart)

This is the part that makes it safe to let strangers publish. A Kortix item is
not inert data: a skill is **instructions an autonomous agent will follow**, and
a tool is **code that runs in the session sandbox** with the project's
`KORTIX_TOKEN`, connectors, and secrets. The threat model is real:
prompt-injection-style skills, tools that exfiltrate secrets or abuse a
connector, and network egress.

### 5.1 The capability manifest + consent (the single most important feature)

Every item **declares its capabilities**, and the user **approves them at
install**. Nothing is granted silently.

```jsonc
"meta": {
  "capabilities": {
    "secrets":    ["OPENAI_API_KEY"],          // env it reads
    "connectors": ["gmail", "slack"],          // integrations it calls
    "network":    ["api.openai.com"],          // egress it expects (allowlist)
    "tools":      ["web_search"],              // tools it invokes
    "writes":     ["@skills/", "@memory/"]     // where it writes
  }
}
```

On install the CLI/gallery shows: *"`cold-email` wants: your `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
the Gmail connector, and network to api.openai.com. Allow?"* This is the
permission-dialog model (mobile apps, OAuth scopes, browser extensions) applied
to agent capabilities. It converts "others push shit" from *trust the author*
into *trust nothing, approve explicitly*.

### 5.2 Containment is the backstop

Capabilities are declared, but **enforcement leans on what's already true**: a
skill executes inside the **isolated session sandbox** (its own container,
project-scoped token). The blast radius of a malicious item is **one project's
sandbox + the connectors/secrets that project already holds** — not the user's
machine, not other projects, not the platform. The marketplace's job is to keep
that radius *informed and consented*, not to invent new isolation.

### 5.3 Static gates before listing

At submit/index time, automated checks (a model reviewer is well-suited here):
- **Secret scanning** — refuse items that embed credentials.
- **Capability honesty** — diff declared capabilities vs. what the files
  actually reference (a tool that hits a domain not in `network` → flagged).
- **Dangerous-pattern scan** — tool code that reads `KORTIX_TOKEN` and POSTs it
  out, obvious exfiltration, `curl | sh`, etc.
- **Schema + install dry-run** — `registry validate` must pass; a sandboxed
  dry-run must produce only in-`target` writes.

### 5.4 Provenance & integrity

- **Content hashes** in the lock (built) → tamper-evident installs.
- **Pin-by-sha** on unpinned installs → reproducible.
- **Signed provenance** (roadmap): publishers sign releases (sigstore-style);
  the index records the signature; `kortix marketplace install` can require verified provenance
  at the global tier.
- **Publish cooldown.** Mirror the supply-chain defense **this repo already runs
  in pnpm** (`minimumReleaseAge: 4320` — a 72h cooldown that defeats
  publish-and-yank account-takeover attacks like Shai-Hulud / TanStack). A newly
  published global item is installable by name immediately *only* if pinned;
  the *floating* "latest" lags by a cooldown so a compromised publisher can't
  instantly poison everyone on `@latest`.

### 5.5 Naming attacks

- **Typosquatting:** namespaces (`@kortix/pdf` vs `randoguy/pdf`) + verified
  publishers + the gallery ranking official/verified above community.
- **Dependency confusion:** a company namespace (`@acme/*`) always resolves to
  the company registry first; a public item can never shadow it.

### 5.6 Trust tiers (who can publish what, with how much review)

| Ring | Who | Review | Capability ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Repo** | anyone, their own repo | none (you typed it) | unrestricted (your risk) |
| **Company** | org members → org registry | org policy / optional review | org-approved connectors/secrets |
| **Global – community** | anyone, after submit | automated gates (5.3) + cooldown | must declare caps; secrets need consent every install |
| **Global – verified** | verified publishers | automated + human spot-check + signed | may be allowlisted for one-tap installs |

---

## Part 6 — Listing & ownership

**Listing = make a repo reachable, then (for global) submit it to the index.**

1. `kortix registry build` -> `registry.json` -> `git push`. *(Repo tier done now.)*
2. **Company:** push to the org registry repo; appears in **Customize → Add**.
3. **Global:** the Marketplace submission flow takes the **repo URL + chosen
   namespace**. Kortix validates, runs static gates,
   indexes the items, records the checksum, and lists them.

**Ownership & names.** A **namespace** (`@acme`) is claimed once, tied to a
Kortix account/org, and verified by proving control of the repo (a file or a
GitHub App grant). Item names are unique within a namespace. **Name transfer**
and **takedown/yank** are index operations (we own the index, not the files).

**Health.** The index periodically re-crawls + re-validates registries; a repo
that 404s or fails validation is marked unhealthy and de-ranked, not silently
broken for installers (the cache + lock still serve pinned installs).

---

## Part 7 — Discovery & curation

- **Search** over the denormalized item index (name, title, description,
  categories, type, namespace).
- **Signals:** install count, "kept" rate (installed-and-not-removed), freshness,
  verified-publisher badge, hand-curated "official" flag. Rank official/verified
  above community; never purely by raw installs (gameable).
- **Collections / use-cases:** curated bundles ("Sales agent starter", "Finance
  pack") — these are just `registry:bundle` items, dog-fooding the primitive.
- **The gallery (`/marketplace`)** = browse + filter by type/category + an item
  page (readme, files, capabilities, "Add to project"). Item page is rendered
  from the same item JSON the CLI consumes — one source of truth.

---

## Part 8 — Lifecycle

- `kortix marketplace install` — install (built).
- `kortix outdated` — compare lock hashes vs. current source refs → what changed.
- `kortix update [item]` — re-resolve → **diff** → apply on confirm (re-pin lock).
- `kortix remove <item>` — delete its locked files + lock entry (clean uninstall
  because the lock knows exactly what it wrote).
- **Drift detection** — a locked file edited locally is shown on update so we
  never clobber a user's edits without telling them (the lock hash ≠ disk hash).
- **Breaking changes** — surfaced via the diff + optional `meta.version` semver
  + deprecation notes. We don't auto-migrate; we *show* and let the user choose.

---

## Part 9 — What Kortix actually stores (because it's index-not-host)

A small amount of metadata, no files:

- **`registries`** — id, namespace, repo URL, owner account/org, visibility
  (public/company), verification state, health, last-indexed sha, stats.
- **`registry_items`** (denormalized index for search) — registry id, name,
  type, title, description, categories, declared capabilities, latest sha/hash.
- **`registry_checksums`** — `(source, path, sha) → hash` checksum authority.
- *(optional)* **`registry_cache`** — read-through blob cache keyed by hash.

No file storage, no per-install rows beyond what the project's own
`registry-lock.json` already holds. The marketplace DB is tiny and mostly a
search/trust projection of public git state.

---

## Part 10 — Governance & economics (foresight, not now)

- **Moderation:** report → triage → yank/de-list. Index-side, reversible.
- **Paid items (future):** the same item model + an entitlement check at install
  (gallery mints a short-lived signed grant; the file fetch requires it).
  Revenue-share like Raycast Store / shadcn Pro. Deliberately deferred — the
  free, open, repo-is-a-registry path must be first-class and never gated.
- **Licensing:** items carry an SPDX `meta.license`; the gallery surfaces it.

---

## Part 11 — Phased rollout

1. **P0 — Engine + CLI (DONE).** Format, build, resolve, install, lock, and
   `kortix marketplace`. Repo-tier sharing works today with zero backend.
2. **P1 — Cloud install.** `kortix marketplace install --project <id>` commits into a linked
   repo via `POST /projects/:id/files/commit` (reusing `commitFileToBranch`).
   Plus `kortix update/outdated/remove`.
3. **P2 — Capability manifest + consent.** Declare + approve. The safety
   foundation; do this *before* opening global publishing.
4. **P3 — Company registries.** Org registry repo + Customize → Add, private via
   the git-proxy.
5. **P4 — Global index + gallery.** Submit/index/checksum service, `/marketplace`
   UI, search, verified publishers, cooldown, static gates.
6. **P5 — Provenance signing, paid items, collections.**

Gate: **don't open global community publishing (P4) until the capability
manifest + consent (P2) and static gates ship.** Opening a marketplace before
the trust model is the classic mistake.

---

## Part 12 — Anti-goals (what we deliberately do NOT do)

- **We don't host files.** Git does. We index + checksum.
- **We don't invent a package format.** We extend shadcn's; interop is a feature.
- **We don't gate the repo tier.** Anyone can run their own registry with zero
  Kortix involvement — that openness is the moat, not a leak.
- **We don't reinvent semver/VCS.** Refs + content hashes, Go-style.
- **We don't auto-update or auto-run.** Installs and updates are explicit,
  diffable commits a human (or a reviewing agent) signs off on.
- **We don't trust publishers by default.** We trust the lock, the sandbox, and
  explicit consent.
