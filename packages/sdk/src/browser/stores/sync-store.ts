//
// The wire's own `EventMessagePartDelta` (`@opencode-ai/sdk`'s
// `v2/gen/types.gen.d.ts`) carries a top-level `id: string` on every event —
// NOT inside `properties`, so `applyEvent`'s `message.part.delta` case now

// `eventID` param. Two independently-broadcast SSE readers of the SAME
// published event (a stacked connection, a second subscriber) both receive
// the identical event object and therefore the identical `id` — which makes
// event identity the correct dedupe key, not delta CONTENT: content-based
// dedupe (e.g. "reject a delta whose text matches the last one applied at
// this length") would false-positive on legitimately-repeated content, such
// as streaming "..." one identical character at a time.
//
// Keyed by session (same shape/reason as the maps above), then by
// `${messageID}:${partID}:${field}` (a part could in principle accumulate
// more than one delta-bearing field) to the SET of event ids already applied
// for that key. A stacked duplicate connection can redeliver a whole tail of
// the stream, not just the single most-recent event — "replay the last N
// deltas again" is exactly what a reconnect-and-resume does — so every
// applied id for the key is kept, not just the last one; a Set lookup stays
// O(1) either way. Bounded by the per-session clears below, so this never
// grows across an entire session's lifetime, only within one streaming turn.

// So: reference-count the mounted consumers of each session and free it once

/**
 * Prune the detached window down to {@link DETACHED_SESSION_LIMIT}, freeing the

 * since refilled. Returns the ids it freed.
 *
 * The second half is what keeps eviction from being a one-shot. Eviction takes
 * a session OUT of the detach window, so an agent still running in it puts
 * `messages[id]` back — through SSE, with nobody watching — and that data then
 * has no path out of memory again. Re-checking {@link evictedSessions} on every
 * prune gives it one: the next mount of any session sweeps it, exactly like the
 * first time. It stays marked, because the user can still come back to it.
 *
 * Runs when a session is RETAINED, never when one is released. React runs every
 * passive destroy before any passive create in a commit, so pruning on release
 * would let the unmount of B evict A in the very commit that mounts A: visit
 * A → X → Y → B and go back to A, and A is the oldest of four detached
 * sessions at exactly the wrong moment. Pruning after the incoming session has
 * been removed from the window makes that unreachable, and keeps `set()` out of
 * the unmount path entirely.
 *
 * The window therefore holds at most LIMIT + (releases since the last retain),
 * and is back to LIMIT the moment any session mounts.
 *
 * Synchronous on purpose. Deferring it (a microtask, a post-commit hook) so
 * that every retain in a commit lands first would buy nothing, because the
 * ordering it would buy is already guaranteed. The case that motivates
 * deferral is a parent's spawn-tool preview of a child session, and the
 * preview's `useOpenCodeMessages(childId)` is always a React DESCENDANT of the
 * component that retains the parent (`SessionLayout` → the transcript → the
 * tool part). React runs passive effects bottom-up, so in any commit that
 * mounts both, the child's retain lands before the parent's — and therefore
 * before the prune the parent's retain triggers. Deferral would only cost the
 * determinism that keeps unmount out of the eviction path.
 *
 * (The argument this replaces claimed the child's data "arrives a commit or
 * more after the parent mounts". That is not universally true — a parent whose
 * transcript is already resident renders it in the mount commit — and the
 * conclusion never depended on it.)
 *
 * The residual hazard is narrower than it looks, and worth naming exactly.
 * Only a child session the user opened DIRECTLY and then left is ever an
 * eviction candidate; one that was only ever previewed was never retained, and
 * `retainSession` leaves sessions it has never seen alone. What such a child
 * loses is its `messages`/`parts` — `sessionStatus` survives eviction on
 * purpose (see `dropSessionData`), so a preview's retry banner keeps reading.
 * A preview showing a transcript has no repaint path of its own, so closing
 * the rest needs the reference declared before the data is read — either the
 * host retaining child ids when it parses the parent's transcript, or
 * `useOpenCodeMessages` reading the disk cache the way `useSessionSync` does.
 * The second needs the child's `kortixSessionScope` plumbed through from the
 * host: entries written for an opened session are keyed
 * `…:kortix-session:<scope>`, so a scopeless read looks up a different key and
 * misses (idb-sync-cache-key.ts:6-9).
