 * attach the real one later. Nothing else ever revisits the bucket, so before
 * this it outlived both eviction and `clearSession`: the leak this file's
 * retention work exists to close, left open on the one path that produces it.
 *
 * Attribution is by `Part.sessionID`, which is what those stub parts carry.
 * `every` rather than `some` so a bucket is only freed when the whole thing is
 * this session's; a bucket whose parts arrived without a `sessionID` is
 * unattributable and deliberately left alone rather than guessed at.

 * decide whether the IndexedDB transcript may repaint. An empty array reads as
 * "loaded, and empty", which would leave a returning user staring at a blank
 * transcript that never repaints.
 *
 * `sessionStatus` is deliberately NOT dropped. It is the one slice read for
 * sessions that are on purpose not resident — a parent's spawn-tool banner
 * reads `sessionStatus[child]` for a child whose transcript the parent never
 * holds (`tool/shared/sub-agent.tsx`, `tool/tools/removed-connector-tool.tsx`).
 * Dropping it bought no memory either: every `session.status` frame, and the
 * connect-time `client.session.status()` poll, re-add an entry for every
 * session on the runtime whether or not it is resident, so the delete was
 * undone on the next frame — while the gap was visible to the user. One small
 * status object per session is not the memory this eviction reclaims; the

/**
 * Prune the detached window down to {@link DETACHED_SESSION_LIMIT}, freeing the
 * oldest sessions past it, plus any already-evicted session the live stream has
 * since refilled. Returns the ids it freed.
 *
 * The second half is what keeps eviction from being a one-shot. Eviction takes
 * a session OUT of the detach window, so an agent still running in it puts
 * `messages[id]` back — through SSE, with nobody watching — and that data then
 * has no path out of memory again. Re-checking {@link evictedSessions} on every
 * prune gives it one: the next mount of any session sweeps it, exactly like the
 * first time. It stays marked, because the user can still come back to it.
 *
 * Runs when a session is RETAINED, never when one is released. React runs every
 * passive destroy before any passive create in a commit, so pruning on release
 * would let the unmount of B evict A in the very commit that mounts A: visit
 * A → X → Y → B and go back to A, and A is the oldest of four detached
 * sessions at exactly the wrong moment. Pruning after the incoming session has
 * been removed from the window makes that unreachable, and keeps `set()` out of
 * the unmount path entirely.
 *
 * The window therefore holds at most LIMIT + (releases since the last retain),
 * and is back to LIMIT the moment any session mounts.
 *
 * Synchronous on purpose. Deferring it (a microtask, a post-commit hook) so
 * that every retain in a commit lands first would buy nothing, because the
 * ordering it would buy is already guaranteed. The case that motivates
 * deferral is a parent's spawn-tool preview of a child session, and the
 * preview's `useOpenCodeMessages(childId)` is always a React DESCENDANT of the
 * component that retains the parent (`SessionLayout` → the transcript → the
 * tool part). React runs passive effects bottom-up, so in any commit that
 * mounts both, the child's retain lands before the parent's — and therefore
 * before the prune the parent's retain triggers. Deferral would only cost the
 * determinism that keeps unmount out of the eviction path.
 *
 * (The argument this replaces claimed the child's data "arrives a commit or
 * more after the parent mounts". That is not universally true — a parent whose
 * transcript is already resident renders it in the mount commit — and the
 * conclusion never depended on it.)
 *
 * The residual hazard is narrower than it looks, and worth naming exactly.
 * Only a child session the user opened DIRECTLY and then left is ever an
 * eviction candidate; one that was only ever previewed was never retained, and
 * `retainSession` leaves sessions it has never seen alone. What such a child
 * loses is its `messages`/`parts` — `sessionStatus` survives eviction on
 * purpose (see `dropSessionData`), so a preview's retry banner keeps reading.
 * A preview showing a transcript has no repaint path of its own, so closing
 * the rest needs the reference declared before the data is read — either the
 * host retaining child ids when it parses the parent's transcript, or
 * `useOpenCodeMessages` reading the disk cache the way `useSessionSync` does.
 * The second needs the child's `kortixSessionScope` plumbed through from the
 * host: entries written for an opened session are keyed
 * `…:kortix-session:<scope>`, so a scopeless read looks up a different key and
 * misses (idb-sync-cache-key.ts:6-9).
