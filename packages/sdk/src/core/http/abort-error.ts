/**
 * The one abort classifier. Every producer of an "this turn was aborted"
 * error in this codebase — the SDK's own optimistic patch, the real opencode
 * wire error, and a plain `AbortController`/`fetch` abort — ends up here.
 *
 * Before this file, FOUR divergent detectors existed across `apps/web` and
 * this package: an identity read, a prose sniff with its own pattern lists, a
 * duck-typed name/message check, and a loose `/abort/i` regex. They agreed
 * often enough to hide the disagreements — e.g. `/abort/i` matches "aborted"
 * as a substring of a transport-failure message ("upstream unreachable …
 * The operation was aborted"), mislabeling a real failure as a user-initiated
 * stop. `isAbortError` is the single, documented replacement.
 *
 * Producers (studied, not guessed):
 * - `SyntheticAbortError` — the client-synthesized marker patched onto a
 *   message when the user hits Stop, or when a runtime disposes mid-stream.
 *   `{ name: "AbortError", data: { message: string } }`. See
 *   `react/use-session-send.ts` (`applyOptimisticAbort`) and
 *   `react/use-opencode-events/use-event-stream-refs.ts`
 *   (`markSessionAbortedLocally`).
 * - `MessageAbortedError` — the real opencode wire shape, one member of
 *   `AssistantMessage['error']` (`@opencode-ai/sdk` `types.gen.d.ts`).
 *   `{ name: "MessageAbortedError", data: { message: string } }`.
 * - A `DOMException`/`Error`-shaped `AbortError` from a real
 *   `AbortController`/`fetch` abort. `.name === "AbortError"`.
