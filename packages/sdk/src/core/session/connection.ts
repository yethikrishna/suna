/**
 * ONE answer to "what is this session's runtime doing", for every surface that
 * draws it.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The frontend had four independent sources for that question — the control
 * plane's session row, a health probe, the runtime's SSE frames, and the
 * control plane's turn ledger — and every surface picked its own subset. The
 * composer's notice read the probe, the sidebar dot read the row, the Stop
 * button read the ledger and the stream. Each source has its own latency and
 * its own failure mode, so on a cold load they answer in an arbitrary order and
 * the surfaces disagree with each other and with the screen.
 *
 * Worse, the composer's notice treated the ABSENCE of an answer as an answer.
 * A page reload of a session whose sandbox is up and mid-turn showed "Waking
 * this session up…" for seconds before the runtime replied (screen recording,
 * essentia 2026-08-24) — a negative claim asserted from having asked nobody.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A negative claim needs positive evidence. `unknown` is a real state and it is
 * the honest one until something answers; nothing may render an alarm from it.
 *
 * Pure, so each rule below is a test rather than a habit.
