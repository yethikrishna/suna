/**
 * The rules a message queue obeys, as pure functions.
 *
 * A message typed while the agent is mid-run is held until the turn ends. That
 * much is easy. What is not easy — and what three previous implementations got
 * wrong — is *when* it is released and *how many times*.
 *
 * The failures this module exists to make impossible:
 *
 *   - **Two drains, one message sent twice.** `claimNext` records the claim in
 *     the same transition that returns the item. A second claim against the
 *     returned state gets nothing. There is no ref to read stale, no effect
 *     ordering to reason about, no window between deciding to send and having
 *     said so.
 *   - **A failed head locking out every later send.** `failInFlight` moves the
 *     item to `failed` and leaves `pending` immediately drainable. This is the
 *     exact lockout that caused the client queue to be deleted wholesale in
 *     `67749c1f76`; it cannot recur here.
 *   - **A queued message sending under the wrong model.** `agent`, `model`, and
 *     `variant` are captured at enqueue and carried verbatim.
 *
 * The claimed item stays at `pending[0]` while it is in flight rather than
 * being spliced out. That makes `inFlightId` a real lock (one field to check),
 * makes "reorder cannot cross the in-flight slot" an index clamp rather than a
 * special case, and means a crash between claim and dispatch leaves the message
 * visible in the queue instead of silently gone.
 *
 * Framework-free, storage-free, and timer-free by construction. There is no
 * `Date.now()` and no `crypto` here: ids and timestamps are inputs, so every
 * transition is deterministic and testable without fakes. Persistence and the
 * decision of *when* the turn ended belong to the host.
