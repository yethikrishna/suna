/**
 * Is anything actually listening on a session's proxied port?
 *
 * An `<iframe>` cannot answer that. It fires `onLoad` when a document renders
 * and `onError` almost never, so a host that watches only the frame has exactly
 * one signal — silence — and silence covers two opposite states: a dev server
 * still compiling its first route (30-60s is normal) and a port with nothing
 * behind it. Every host that guessed between them from a stopwatch guessed
 * wrong on cold starts.
 *
 * This asks the proxy instead. The preview proxy answers `502/503/504` ITSELF
 * when it cannot open a connection to the port, so a negative verdict comes
 * back fast and does not depend on the app being quick. A positive verdict is
 * only ever as fast as the app.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `authenticatedFetch`: the preview proxy authenticates a
 * browser with the `__preview_session` cookie, and an `Authorization` header
 * would make this a non-simple cross-origin request and cost a CORS preflight
 * on every probe. Same auth path the iframe itself uses.
 */

/**
 * What one probe learned about a port.
 *
 * `unknown` is a first-class answer, not an error case: a CORS refusal, an
 * offline browser, an expired preview cookie, or a probe that outran its own
 * timeout all say nothing about the port. A caller must never turn `unknown`
 * into a failure verdict.

 * Default ceiling on a single probe, ms.
 *
 * The proxy's "nothing is listening" answer needs no upstream connection and

 * It exists for the opposite case: an app that accepted the connection and then
 * stalled — which is itself already weak evidence the port is up, and holding
 * the socket open longer cannot change that.
 *
 * Deliberately SHORT. A caller decides a port is dead from repeated misses
 * inside some window of its own, and a probe whose ceiling approaches that
 * window can consume the caller's entire sampling budget in ONE stalled
 * sample. Three seconds leaves room for several samples inside any window
 * worth having. A probe that outruns it resolves `unknown` and can never
 * itself declare a port dead.

 *   `isImmediateOfflineStatus`, which applies the same rule to the runtime's
 *   own health probe).
 * - `401/403` — the preview proxy's auth gate, i.e. OUR cookie, not the app.
 *   Reading these as failure would blame a user's app for our expired session.
 * - any other real HTTP status — a server accepted the connection and replied.
 *   A 404 or a 500 is the app answering, which is exactly what "the port is up"
 *   means.
 * - anything outside the HTTP range (`0` from an unreadable/opaque response, or
 *   a nonsense number) — no answer to classify.
