 * Framing a file from the sandbox's static file server.
 *
 * A host that wants to SHOW an HTML file has exactly one correct move: load it
 * from the server that ships inside the sandbox (port 3211, `/open?path=…`) and
 * frame that URL. The tempting shortcut — hand the file's text to an iframe as
 * `srcDoc` — cannot work, and not for a reason a flag can fix: `srcDoc` gives
 * the document no URL at all, so `./style.css`, `img/logo.png` and `app.js`
 * have no base to resolve against. A page written as a page arrives unstyled.
 *
 * Two rules live here rather than in the hook, because both are decisions and
 * neither needs a network to be reasoned about.

 * the server was up, the URL was authenticated, and the check said it belonged
 * to a different file. A prefix is wrong in the other direction too —
 * `a.html.bak` starts with the URL for `a.html`.
