/**
 * Connects to the opencode SSE event stream and keeps it alive: heartbeat
 * watchdog, event coalescing + batched flush, gap-triggered rehydrate signal,
 * and exponential-backoff reconnect. Framework-free — safe to call from any
 * host (the React wrapper calls this once per effect run; a non-React host can
 * call it directly).
 *
 * **Shared-stream fan-out.** A second concurrent open for a client that
 * already has a live stream (see `liveStreamsByClient`) does NOT tear the
 * first one down — it SHARES it. Realistic sources of a stacked open:
 * a second mounted subscriber opening its own stream for the same runtime
 * without closing an existing one (e.g. an out-of-order remount), or a
 * programmatic consumer that opens more than one handle for the same
 * runtime on purpose. Each `openEventStream()` call gets its own
 * independent `EventStreamHandle`; `close()` decrements a refcount on the
 * shared connection, and the underlying connection (and its timers) tears
 * down only once the LAST subscriber closes. Every subscriber's
 * `onEvent`/`onGapRehydrate`/`onParked` still fires for every event —
 * exactly once each, off the single underlying wire connection, so no
 * subscriber has to be idempotent against a duplicate delivery the way
 * `sync-store.ts`'s `applyPartDelta` separately guards against.
 *
 * Only the FIRST caller's `connectTimeoutMs`/`heartbeatTimeoutMs`/
 * `maxConsecutiveHardFailures`/`timers` govern the shared connection — a
 * later joiner's values for those fields are not consulted (see
 * `createLiveStream`'s doc comment). `signal` is per-subscriber: aborting a
 * caller's own signal only closes THAT caller's handle, not the shared
 * connection (unless it was the last one standing).
