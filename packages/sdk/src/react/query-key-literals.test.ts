/**
 * Structural guard for the bug this fix wave found: `apps/web` moved onto
 * `qk` (`query-keys.ts`), but `packages/sdk/src/react` — the package that
 * OWNS `qk` — kept hand-typing the old flat literals. Same fetcher, two
 * different cache entries, silently. `apps/web/eslint.config.mjs` has a
 * `no-restricted-syntax` rule for exactly this — but it is scoped to
 * `files: ['src/**']` under `apps/web`, and `packages/sdk` has NO eslint
 * config and no lint script, so that rule structurally cannot see this
 * package. This test is the substitute guard: it runs inside the existing
 * `bun test` gate (`packages/sdk`'s CI + the TDD workflow's mandatory
 * `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk test`), which every change here already has to
 * pass, so a reintroduced literal fails the SAME gate a broken type or a
 * failing unit test would.
 *
 * ## Why this is default-DENY, and no longer a list of banned families
 *
 * The first version enumerated the four families the review happened to
 * name — `detail`, `sessions`, `secrets`, `model-picker`. That list was
 * wrong TWICE, and both times in the same direction: it silently permitted
 * a literal the migration had just removed.
 *
 *  1. `['project-session', …]` — SINGULAR. What `session-title-sync.ts` and
 *     `use-canonical-opencode-session.ts` hand-typed before the migration.
 *     `sessions` in the alternation never matched it.
 *  2. `['project-triggers', …]` — the second live evasion the migration
 *     closed, in `settings-view.tsx` and `schedule-view.tsx`.
 *
 * An enumerated ban list can only ever cover the mistakes someone already
 * made. It fails open for the next one, which is the wrong direction for a
 * regression guard. So the polarity is inverted: EVERY `project`/`projects`/
 * `project-<family>` array literal in this directory is a violation, and the
 * handful that are legitimately not `qk`'s business are named, one line
 * each, below. Adding a new hand-typed family now requires a deliberate,
 * reviewable edit to `ALLOWED_SUFFIXES` — it cannot happen by omission.
 *
 * This also removes the alternation-ordering trap the old pattern had:
 * `project-(detail|sessions|secrets)` is ordered first-match, so listing
 * `session` before `sessions` would have shadowed it. There is no
 * alternation left to order.
 *
 * `apps/web`'s eslint rule targets `/^projects?(-[a-z-]+)?$/`; this now
 * matches it, minus the exemptions below, which do not exist in `apps/web`.
 *
 * ## Why not just reuse apps/web's pattern with no exemptions
 *
 * Three `project-*` literals in this directory are NOT `qk`-eligible and a
 * bare port of that rule would false-flag all three. Each is listed in
 * `ALLOWED_SUFFIXES` with the reason. Two of them are real query families
 * that were never part of the `qk` migration; auditing and migrating them is
 * real work with its own blast radius, not something to smuggle into a
 * regression guard. The third is not a query key at all.
 *
 * ## Limits, stated rather than implied
 *
 * A single-line regex scan, not an AST walk — every offending site this fix
 * wave found was a one-line flat array literal, and `packages/sdk` has no
 * parser-based tooling wired up. A literal split across lines slips through.
 * Lines that BEGIN with a comment marker are skipped, because several files
 * here quote the removed literals in prose to explain what was removed; a
 * literal that merely has a trailing comment is still scanned. Keys built
 * from a variable or a helper call need data-flow analysis and are out of
 * reach for a syntactic rule — the same residual evasion `apps/web`'s rule
 * documents and accepts.
