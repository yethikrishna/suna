/**
 * The one place a Kortix query key is constructed.
 *
 * Before this existed, `apps/web` hand-typed roughly 176 key literals across
 * 30 `project*` families. One entity therefore had several cache entries (the
 * flat `project-sessions` key and the flat `project-session-inventory` key
 * held the same server data), and one key had several freshness contracts, because
 * `staleTime` is per-observer and seven call sites disagreed about it.
 *
 * The first version of `sessions(id)` repeated that exact mistake one level
 * down: it dropped `listProjectSessions`'s `scope` argument, so a
 * `scope: 'visible'` reader and a `scope: 'project'` reader (a DIFFERENT
 * server request — see `sessions` below) shared one cache slot, and
 * whichever fetch resolved last silently overwrote what the other scope's
 * readers saw. Anything that changes the response MUST be part of the key —
 * that is the rule this file exists to enforce, and it is not optional just
 * because the argument is easy to forget.
 *
 * The SECOND version of `sessions(id, scope)` fixed that, then introduced a
 * narrower version of the same class of bug: `sessions(id, scope)` and
 * `session(id, sessionId)` were both `sessionsScope(id)` plus exactly one
 * segment, so a session id equal to a scope literal (`'visible'`,
 * `'project'`) would collide byte-for-byte with a scoped list. Nothing in
 * THIS file prevented that — the only thing standing in the way was a UUID
 * regex enforced server-side, in `apps/api`, a different package, with no
 * link back here. `sessions` now inserts a literal `'list'` segment so it is
 * structurally longer than `session(...)` for every possible session id —
 * the collision is unrepresentable, not merely unlikely.
 *
 * Two rules make this work:
 *
 *  1. `scope(id)` is a PREFIX, never a query key. Everything belonging to one
 *     project sits under it, so `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: scope(id) })`
 *     provably reaches all of it.
 *  2. Nothing derived from another query gets its own key. Skills, commands
 *     and agents are `config.*` fields of the project detail response, not
 *     separate fetches — they are `select` projections over `detail(id)`.
 *
 * Not to be confused with `kortixKeys` in `use-kortix-master.ts`, which
 * addresses the multi-server Kortix Master surface and means something else.
 *
 * The root segment below is `'kx'`, not `'kortix'`. `'kortix'` is already
 * `kortixKeys`'s root (`use-kortix-master.ts:276-279`):
 * `kortixKeys.projects() = ['kortix', 'projects']` and
 * `kortixKeys.project(id) = ['kortix', 'projects', id]`. If this factory also
 * rooted at `'kortix'`, `kortixKeys.project(id)` and `qk.projects.list(id)`
 * would be the identical array for a matching id — one cache entry standing
 * in for two unrelated concepts — and `kortixKeys.projects()` (used as an
 * `invalidateQueries` prefix at `use-kortix-master.ts:371,384`) would also
 * match every key this factory produces, since TanStack matches query keys by
 * prefix. `'kx'` makes the two factories disjoint at segment 0, so neither
 * can ever prefix-match the other. Do not "tidy" this back to `'kortix'`.
