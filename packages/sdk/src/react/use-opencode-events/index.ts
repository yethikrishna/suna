/**
 * Connects to OpenCode's SSE event stream via the SDK and
 * performs INCREMENTAL cache updates on React Query data.
 *
 * Instead of invalidating queries (which triggers full refetches),
 * we use setQueryData to surgically update messages, parts, sessions, etc.
 * This matches the SolidJS reference implementation's approach.
 *
 * This hook is a THIN React wrapper: the actual connect/reconnect/backoff,
 * heartbeat watchdog, and event-coalescing machinery is framework-free and
 * lives in `state/event-stream.ts`'s `openEventStream()`. Everything here is
 * either genuinely React-only (effect lifecycle, store subscriptions) or
 * needs the React Query `QueryClient` (cache reads/writes, which
 * `createEventHandler` and `hydrateCore` below perform).
