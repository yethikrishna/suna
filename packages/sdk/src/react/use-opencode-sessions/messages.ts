// delivered. It identifies a delivery by the caller's `Idempotency-Key` header
// or — when there is none, which is always for a browser, since that header is
// not on the API's CORS allow-list — by a **sha256 of the request body**, with a
// 60s TTL (`apps/api/src/sandbox-proxy/prompt-dedupe.ts`, `promptDeliveryKey`).
// A repeat is answered `200 {"status":"duplicate","deduplicated":true}` and
// never reaches opencode.
//
// The payload below is built from the session id, the mapped parts (whose
// client ids are dropped), and the model/agent picks — nothing else. So sending
// the same text twice within 60s produced a BYTE-IDENTICAL body, and the second
// submission was silently lost: no error, no turn, nothing on screen. Minting a
// per-submission id makes the two bodies differ by construction, while a RETRY
// of one submission keeps its id so the proxy's real duplicate protection still
// fires (see the retry loop in `promptOpenCodeMessage`).
//
// "One submission" is bigger than one call. The internal retry loop is only the
// retry the SDK owns; a host retries too — apps/web's message queue re-dispatches
// a failed entry through `retry` → `sendQueuedMessage` → `handleSend` →
// `sendParts`, which lands here as a FRESH call. Minting per call there would
// deliver a prompt that reached opencode but reported failure a SECOND time, and
// the second prompt aborts the turn the first one started. So the caller may
// name its submission with `clientMessageId` — the queue entry's own stable key
// (`QueuedMessageInput.clientMessageId`) — and every dispatch of that submission
// resolves to the one wire id.
//
// The caller names the submission; this module still owns the wire FORMAT.
// A host id (`cm_12`, or `ascendingId`'s `msg_19ff…`, which encodes the wrong
// bits — see the warning on it) cannot be used on the wire: opencode orders by
// the id's clock prefix, so a badly-shaped id reads as already-answered and the
