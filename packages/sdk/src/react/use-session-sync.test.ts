/**
 * WHICH signal switches the transcript liveness poll.
 *
 * Every REST prompt used to arm it explicitly, so sending guaranteed the tail
 * was pulled behind SSE. That path is gone, and the only remaining switch read
 * the raw `session.status` slot — a stream this tab can miss frames from. Drop
 * the busy frame (a backgrounded tab, a proxy reconnect across the start of a
 * turn) and the poll never started, while `useSessionWorking` correctly read
 * the session as working off the server's turn authority: the turn rendered as
 * working with no assistant content until the user reloaded.
 *
 * The switch is the working PROJECTION when the caller has one, and the stream
 * slot only when it does not (apps/mobile, which mounts no projection).
