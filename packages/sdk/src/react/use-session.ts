/**
 * useSession — the ONE hook a host needs to open a session and stream a chat.
 *
 * Everything sandbox-shaped is internal: it drives `/start` (server long-poll),
 * points the runtime at the session's sandbox, opens the SSE stream, resolves the
 * canonical OpenCode id, and syncs messages — exposing one `phase`
 * (starting|ready|error) plus messages/send/abort/questions/permissions and the
 * server-side capabilities (models/agents/commands/picks). The host imports
 * `createKortix` + `useSession` and NOTHING else runtime-related: no server-store,
 * no `switchToSessionSandboxAsync`, no health poller, no event-stream provider.
 *
 * Readiness comes from the SERVER (`stage==='ready'` is only returned after the
 * daemon answered), seeded into the connection store on switch — so there is NO
 * client health poller, and the first turn streams immediately.
 *
 * Call this ONCE per session view (like a provider): it owns the SSE subscription
 * and the `/start` poll for `(projectId, sessionId)`.

 * (`core/rest/projects-client/session-sandbox.ts`), so on a persistent
 * outage `start.error` and `start.data` both stay `null` forever and
 * `shouldPollSessionStart(null, null)` keeps returning `SESSION_START_POLL_MS`
 * — there is no terminal stage and no error ever produced to observe.
 * Without this ceiling, a caller waiting for `/start` to "settle" (e.g. the
 * `phase` derivation below) can never learn it gave up, and a runtime error
 * arriving alongside a wedged `/start` pins that caller in "still starting"
 * forever — a silent hang, strictly worse than a visible error card.
 *
 * A genuine resume never trips this: every poll on a resuming box returns
 * real `data` (a `stage`), so the inconclusive clock keeps resetting and this
 * budget never starts counting — it only fires when `/start` itself has
 * nothing to say, tick after tick. A cold sandbox resume can legitimately
 * take tens of seconds end to end, but that legitimate case is exactly the
 * one that keeps producing data and never reaches this bound.
 *
 * **Worst-case actual flip time is ~61.5s, not 45s** — say so accurately
 * rather than understate it. 45s is 30 consecutive empty poll intervals at
 * `SESSION_START_POLL_MS` (1.5s each), but the budget is only ever CHECKED
 * at a poll tick, and `waitMs` (default
 * `15_000`, the server-side long-poll budget passed to `startProjectSession`)
 * means a single tick's request can itself take up to ~15s before resolving.
 * So the tick that finally crosses the 45s line can itself land up to one
 * full cycle late: `45_000 + (waitMs + SESSION_START_POLL_MS)` ≈
 * `45_000 + 16_500` = `61_500`ms in the worst case. That is still acceptable:
 * it is a finite, single-digit-minutes ceiling on a failure this task
 * otherwise made hang forever, and erring toward a LATE flip (never early)
 * is the safe direction — it never cuts short a legitimate wake, only delays
 * how quickly a genuine outage surfaces its error card.
