/**
 * `useStaticFilePreview` — one file, framed from the server that ships with the
 * sandbox.
 *
 * Every host that shows an HTML file needs the same four things: the proxied
 * URL of the static file server's `/open?path=…` route, an authenticated
 * session for it, a way to wait out a sandbox that is still booting, and a
 * bound on that wait. Each surface that hand-rolled them got a different subset
 * right — see `core/session/static-file-preview.ts` for why `srcDoc` is not an
 * alternative, and why the URL must not be built before a sandbox binds.
 *
 * The caller renders three states and nothing else:
 *
 *   - `checking` — spinner. The sandbox may still be starting.
 *   - `ready` + a `url` — frame it.
 *   - `unavailable` — a sentence and a `retry()`.
 *
 * `url` is non-null ONLY in `ready`, and only once the authenticated URL names
 * THIS file — so a caller cannot accidentally frame an unauthenticated URL, an
 * unbound one, or the file the user just navigated away from.
 *
 * Every wait is bounded. A pending state that can outlive its bound is
 * indistinguishable from a hung one, which is exactly how this surface shipped
 * a spinner that never resolved.
