/**
 * Compose the layered Dockerfile that becomes a session sandbox image.
 *
 * The user's Dockerfile defines whatever workspace they want (language
 * toolchains, system packages, seed data). We append a final stage that
 * makes the result *connectable* by the Kortix dashboard:
 *
 *   1. apt-get install ca-certificates curl git nodejs npm
 *   2. npm install -g opencode-ai@<pinned-version>
 *   3. COPY the kortix-agent + kortix-entrypoint binaries to /usr/local/bin
 *   4. ENV KORTIX_WORKSPACE=/workspace, WORKDIR /workspace, EXPOSE 8000
 *   5. ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/kortix-entrypoint"]
 *
 * The project workspace is NOT baked in — the daemon git-clones it at boot
 * via `KORTIX_PROJECT_AUTO_CLONE`. That keeps the image identity decoupled
 * from project source code, so a code change never invalidates a snapshot
 * and most projects share a single global default image.
 *
 * Steps 1-2 require apt (Debian/Ubuntu family base). Step 5 means the
 * user's ENTRYPOINT is always overridden — see docs/dockerfile.mdx for
 * the user-facing constraint list.

    // agent-browser (Vercel) — the browser-automation CLI the agent-browser
    // skill drives. It must work OUT OF THE BOX with zero runtime download, so we
    // bake a real Chromium into the image and wire agent-browser to it TWO
    // independent ways:
    //   1. AGENT_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH → a stable user-local chromium
    //      symlink (the documented API; verified working on agent-browser 0.27.0).
    //   2. a symlink into agent-browser's OWN browser cache (chrome-linux64),
    //      which its auto-detect finds even if the env var is ever ignored again
    //      — it WAS, historically (vercel-labs/agent-browser#422). Belt + braces.
    // PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH is set BEFORE the install so Chromium lands in
    // /opt/pw-browsers (a stable system path the symlinks resolve against). The
    // build runs as the same `kortix` user as runtime, so the cache symlink lands
    // under its normal home. The build FAILS LOUDLY
    // (chromium --version + `agent-browser doctor`) if Chromium didn't wire up —
    // every sandbox ships a working browser; we never install one on the session
    // hot path.
    //
    // ── LAYER ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING — DO NOT MOVE THIS DOWN ───────────────────
    // This ~150MB Chromium download sits DIRECTLY on top of the deterministic
    // apt + pip floors and DELIBERATELY ABOVE everything below it: the opencode
    // install, the `opencode serve` migration-bake, the config-deps bun install,
    // the per-project warm-repo clone, and the opencode instance warm-up. Several
    // of those layers are NON-DETERMINISTIC by construction — the migration-bake
    // writes a sqlite db with live timestamps, the config-deps install churns
    // node_modules mtimes, and the warm-repo clone bakes a fresh short-lived git
    // credential into its RUN text on every single invocation. The providers'
    // build caches are CONTENT-ADDRESSED (Daytona especially — it has no
    // Docker-style instruction-text cache and no `swapAgent` fast path), so ANY
    // non-deterministic layer BUSTS the cache for everything chained BELOW it.
    //
    // The kortix-agent SOURCE feeds the snapshot fingerprint (see
    // AGENT_RUNTIME_ARTIFACTS in apps/api/src/snapshots/templates.ts), so any
    // agent-server code change mints a BRAND-NEW snapshot name → a full rebuild on
    // Daytona (no agent-swap). If Chromium sat below the migration-bake (as it did
    // through v0.10.11), every such rebuild MISSED cache and re-downloaded ~150MB
    // from cdn.playwright.dev — overrunning the session-ready window and breaking
    // fresh-sandbox boots (the v0.10.11 "session never starts" incident). Keeping
    // Chromium on purely deterministic parents makes its content hash stable
    // across agent-source churn: it is fetched at most ONCE per pinned Playwright/
    // agent-browser version and cache-reused for every rebuild after. The retry
