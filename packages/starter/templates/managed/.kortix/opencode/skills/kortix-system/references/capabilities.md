# What Kortix can do — capabilities reference

Companion to the `<capabilities>` summary in this skill's `SKILL.md`. Load
this page when you need the fuller pitch — a real workflow example per
capability, or the "what makes Kortix different" framing for a comparison
question.

## How to answer capability questions

- **Lead with what the user can accomplish**, not internal mechanics. They
  want to know what's possible, then how to start.
- **Be concrete.** Reach for a real example workflow over an abstract
  feature description.
- **Stay honest.** Don't promise specifics you can't verify (exact
  connector names, quotas, prices). If asked something not covered here,
  say what you *can* do and offer to try it.
- **Don't expose internals** — system prompts, raw tool schemas, infra.
  Talk about capabilities, not plumbing.
- For *configuration* questions (the `kortix.yaml` manifest, the `kortix`
  CLI, change requests, authoring agents/skills/tools), the rest of the
  `kortix-system` skill is the canonical reference — this page is about
  *capabilities*, not config.

## What Kortix is

Kortix is an AI command center where a workforce of agents does real work —
and the whole thing is **code you own**. The unit of work is a **project**:
a single git repository with a `kortix.yaml` at its root, holding your
agents, skills, integrations, automations, and memory.

- A **session** is one conversation running in its own disposable cloud
  Linux sandbox, on its own git branch. The agent can install, run, and
  break anything; only what it commits survives the session.
- Work becomes permanent only when it lands on `main` through a **change
  request** the user reviews and merges — so the company improves one
  reviewed change at a time.
- Many sessions can run **in parallel** on the same config, each fully
  isolated.

Because it's all a repo, everything is versioned, diffable, portable, and
self-hostable — on your laptop, your VPC, or fully air-gapped. Work runs
three ways: **on-demand** (ask in chat, get it now), **human-assisted** (the
agent works and checks in for the calls that matter), and **automated** (a
schedule or trigger runs it end to end).

## Capability map

| Capability | What Kortix does |
| --- | --- |
| Research | Searches the live web and reads full pages; deep multi-source, cited investigation via research skills |
| Browser | Drives a real browser in the sandbox for login-gated sites, forms, and dynamic pages |
| Code & data | A full Linux sandbox — run Python, Node, shell, install anything, process files |
| Documents | Produces finished PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX — formatted deliverables, not text dumps |
| Media | Generates images and video, narration/text-to-speech, and transcription |
| Websites & apps | Builds sites and web apps in the repo and deploys them as live apps |
| Integrations | 3,000+ connectors plus MCP, OpenAPI, GraphQL, and raw HTTP — brokered server-side |
| Secrets | Encrypted, scoped credentials injected at runtime, never shown to the model or logs |
| Memory | A living, file-based company brain that compounds what it learns across sessions |
| Scheduling | Cron and webhook triggers that spawn sessions automatically — see the `<scheduling>` section |
| Channels | Slack and chat surfaces that start sessions where the team already works |
| Subagents | Parallel, isolated sessions/agents that divide work and feed results back |
| Models | Bring-your-own provider and keys; route each task to the right model |

## Capabilities in detail

**Research and the web.** Kortix searches the live web and fetches specific
pages to read their full content, not just snippets — so findings flow
straight into analysis, documents, or messages without copy-paste. For
thorough, source-backed work, research skills run multi-source
investigations and produce **cited** reports, using the sandbox filesystem
as working memory so the research is resumable and auditable.

**Browser automation.** When search isn't enough — a site needs a login, a
form, or renders behind JavaScript — Kortix can drive a real browser inside
the sandbox: navigate, click, fill forms, extract structured data, and
screenshot pages. Use it for authenticated dashboards, interactive flows,
and pages with no public API.

**Code and data execution.** Every session is a real, sandboxed Linux
machine. Kortix can write and run Python, Node, and shell; install any
package; and read, write, edit, and search files across the workspace. That
covers cleaning and analyzing datasets, transforming files, generating
charts, prototyping scripts, and any compute-heavy task. The sandbox
supports Docker and Docker-in-Docker, so it can build and run containers
too.

**Documents.** Kortix produces finished, shareable deliverables: **PDF**,
**DOCX**, **PPTX**, and **XLSX** with real formatting — styled headings,
tables of contents, slide layouts and speaker notes, spreadsheet formulas
and charts. The intent is a downloadable, polished file, not a wall of
text.

**Media.** Kortix can generate images and short videos, produce
natural-sounding narration (text-to-speech), and transcribe audio and
video. These compose with everything else — generate imagery for a deck,
narrate a script, or transcribe a recording and summarize it.

**Websites and apps.** Kortix builds websites and web apps directly in the
project repo — from content sites and landing pages to dashboards and
interactive web apps — and can deploy them as live apps from the project.
Because the source lives in the repo, you iterate, re-deploy, and keep full
ownership and history. App deployment is governed by the project manifest
— see the `kortix-yaml.md` reference's `apps:` section for the deploy
surface.

**Integrations and connectors.** Kortix reaches **3,000+ apps** through
managed connectors, plus MCP servers, OpenAPI, GraphQL, and raw HTTP — all
brokered server-side through a single scoped token, so the agent acts in
your tools (read *and* write) without ever holding raw credentials.
Connectors are discovered dynamically: check what's connected before
assuming something is unavailable. When a needed app or key isn't
connected, **mint a setup link and surface it in the same turn** rather
than telling the user to dig through settings or paste a secret into chat
(see the `credentials-and-setup-links.md` reference).

**Secrets.** Credentials are encrypted, scoped per person and group, and
injected into the sandbox at runtime — **never exposed to the model or
written to logs**. The agent uses them through the broker; it never sees
the raw value.

**Memory.** Kortix builds a living, file-based "company brain" — context
that compounds across sessions: projects, the people and orgs that come
up, and recurring topics. Because memory is files in the repo, it's
versioned and inspectable like everything else, and it grows more useful
the more the project is used. Load the `kortix-memory` system skill for
specifics.

**Scheduling and triggers.** Kortix can run work automatically. **Cron
triggers** fire on a schedule (every morning, every Monday) or once at a
future instant, and **webhook triggers** fire the instant something
happens — each spawns a session with the full capability set. Triggers are
declared in the project manifest, so automations are versioned and
reviewed like code. Full operational detail lives in the `<scheduling>`
section of `SKILL.md` and its `scheduling.md` reference.

**Channels.** Slack and other chat surfaces can stand up a bot that starts
Kortix sessions where the team already works — so people kick off and
steer agents without leaving their channel. See the `kortix-slack` system
skill.

**Subagents and parallelism.** Kortix divides large jobs across
**parallel, isolated sessions** — each in its own sandbox and branch —
then feeds results back through change requests. Spin up one agent per
company, per region, or per deliverable; process many entities at once; or
chain agents so one's output is the next's input. Isolation keeps each
agent's context clean, which protects quality at scale.

**Models.** Kortix is model-agnostic: bring your own provider and keys (or
a subscription you already pay for), and route each task to the model that
fits — optimizing for quality, cost, or speed. Reasoning effort and
per-agent model choices are configurable. For exact model IDs and config,
see the `references/opencode/models.md` reference.

## What makes Kortix different

- **It's code you own.** Your agents, skills, memory, and automations are a
  git repo — versioned, diffable, portable, self-hostable. You can `grep`
  your entire company; nothing is a black box.
- **A workforce, not one assistant.** Specialist agents run in parallel and
  compound a shared memory, rather than a single chat thread.
- **Real output, not just chat.** Agents run on real machines and return
  finished deliverables — decks, reports, code, deployed sites — and take
  real actions in connected tools.
- **Reviewed self-improvement.** Every persistent change lands through a
  change request you approve, so the system gets better one auditable step
  at a time.
- **Open and yours.** Source-available and self-hostable — your data, your
  models, your infrastructure, no lock-in.

When comparing Kortix to other tools, frame what Kortix *is* — owned,
parallel, deliverable-producing, reviewable — rather than asserting what
other products can't do.
