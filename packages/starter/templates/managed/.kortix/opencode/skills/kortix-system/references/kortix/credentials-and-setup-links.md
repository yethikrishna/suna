# Credentials & setup links

How an agent gets the credentials it needs — an API key, a connected app —
**without ever touching a raw secret and without sending the human to go hunting
in a dashboard.** You mint a short-lived **setup link** and surface it; the human
fills it in; you continue.

This is the canonical answer to "I need an API key / I need this app connected."

## The rule (do this, every time)

> **When you need a credential, mint a setup link and surface the URL in your
> reply — in the same turn. Never tell the human to "open the dashboard →
> Customize → Connectors", and never ask them to paste a raw key into chat.**

There are exactly two kinds of credential you'll ever need, and one link each:

| You need… | Mint… | The human gets… |
| --- | --- | --- |
| an **API key / token / secret value** (e.g. `APOLLO_API_KEY`) | a **secret link** | a fill-in form |
| an **app connected** via Pipedream (e.g. `smartlead`, `apollo`) | a **connect link** (Pipedream Quick Connect) | a 1-click authorize |

> **Slack is neither of these.** Connecting Slack is a built-in channel flow:
> run `kortix channels connect` — it prints a one-click "Add to Slack" install
> link. Do NOT mint a secret link for `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`/`SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
> and do NOT add a Pipedream `slack` connector (the slug is reserved).

Both links render the same way everywhere:

- **In the web app** the link opens an in-app **modal/popup** (a fill-in form, or
  the 1-click connect).
- **In Slack / Telegram** the same URL is just a **tappable link** — the human
  opens it on their phone, no login required.

You never see the value. For a connector, no key ever touches chat or the repo.

## Minting a secret link

You name the secret(s); the platform mints a link the human opens to type the
value in. **You never receive the value** — once they submit it, a `runtime`
secret simply appears in your session env (and in `KORTIX_PROJECT_SECRET_NAMES`).

**Preferred — the `request_secret` tool on the `kortix-executor` MCP:**

```
request_secret({ names: ["APOLLO_API_KEY", "SMARTLEAD_API_KEY"],
                 descriptions: { APOLLO_API_KEY: "Settings → API in Apollo" } })
→ { url: "https://<app>/secret-intake/ksl_…", names: [...], expires_at }
```

**Or from a shell** (equivalent):

```sh
kortix secrets request APOLLO_API_KEY SMARTLEAD_API_KEY     # several keys, one link
kortix secrets request APOLLO_API_KEY --scope connector     # server-side only
```

Then **surface the `url`** to the human: *"Add your Apollo key here (expires in
30 min): &lt;url&gt;"*.

- **`scope: runtime`** (default) — the value is injected into your sandbox env,
  so you can read it (`process.env.APOLLO_API_KEY`) or use it from a tool. Use
  this for keys your own code/tools consume.
- **`scope: connector`** — the value is kept server-side only (never injected),
  for credentials resolved by the executor gateway. Use this when a key backs a
  connector, not your env.

One link can request several keys at once — ask for everything you need in a
single message.

## Minting a connect link (Pipedream Quick Connect)

For an app you connect via Pipedream, mint a 1-click connect link. If the
connector isn't on the project yet, **add it instantly first — no change
request**: the `add_connector` tool / `kortix executor add <slug> --provider pipedream
--app <app>` (humans: `kortix connectors add … --apply`). That commits it to
`kortix.yaml` on main and syncs the catalog server-side, exactly like the
dashboard's "Add app" — it's live this session. Then mint the connect link.

**Preferred — the `connect` tool on the `kortix-executor` MCP:**

```
connect({ slug: "smartlead" })
→ { url: "https://<app>/connect/ksl_…", app: "smartlead", expires_at }
```

**Or from a shell:**

```sh
kortix executor connect smartlead    # the executor CLI (matches the MCP `connect` tool)
kortix connectors link smartlead     # the management CLI (durable, shareable link)
```

Then **surface the `url`**. The human clicks → authorizes the app (1-click, or
enters the app's key on Pipedream's hosted page) → the connection is persisted
automatically (a webhook finalizes it; you don't run `kortix connectors
finalize`). The link is durable for its lifetime: each time it's opened it mints
a fresh Pipedream token, so it never goes stale.

> `kortix connectors connect` (no `link`) still exists — it returns a *raw,
> short-lived* Pipedream URL for the dashboard/SDK flow and needs a manual
> `finalize`. For handing a link to a human, prefer `connectors link` /
> the `connect` tool — durable, modal-friendly, auto-finalizing.

## After you surface the link

You don't have a live callback. The smooth flow is:

1. Mint the link and surface it, with a one-line "what this is for".
2. **End your turn** — the human can't fill it in while you hold the turn.
3. When they come back ("done"), **verify and continue**:
   - **Secret:** check the name is now present — `kortix secrets ls` (or look for
     it in `KORTIX_PROJECT_SECRET_NAMES`). A fresh `runtime` value is live in the
     session env immediately (it's hot-synced; no restart needed).
   - **Connector:** check it now appears in your usable catalog —
     `kortix executor connectors` (the `connectors` MCP tool). Unconnected connectors are
     filtered out, so its presence means the credential landed.

If it isn't there yet, the human may not have finished — say so and wait.

---

## Why this is safe (and why it's the only good way)

- The link is an **opaque, encrypted, single-project token** with a short TTL
  (default 30 min, ask for more with `--expires` / `expires_in_minutes`).
- It is **value-only**: it can only *set* the exact key(s) you named, in *this*
  project. It can't read any existing secret and can't target another key — so a
  leaked link is low-blast-radius and expires fast.
- **You never handle the raw value.** The human enters it directly into an
  encrypted store; for a connector, the key only ever lives at Pipedream.

This beats the alternatives you might be tempted by:

- ❌ "Paste your API key here" — puts a raw secret in the chat transcript.
- ❌ "Go to the dashboard → Customize → Connectors → Connect" — the friction that
  makes the human give up. You have a one-click link; use it.
- ❌ `kortix secrets set NAME=<value>` — you don't *have* the value, and you
  shouldn't.

## Quick reference

| Goal | MCP tool | `kortix` CLI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ask the human for a secret value | `request_secret` | `kortix secrets request <NAME…>` |
| Get an app connected (Pipedream) | `connect` | `kortix executor connect <slug>` · `kortix connectors link <slug>` |
| Verify a secret arrived | — | `kortix secrets ls` |
| Verify a connector connected | `connectors` | `kortix executor connectors` · `kortix connectors ls` |

Both surfaces hit the same endpoints and return the same kind of link — use
whichever fits your flow. The MCP tools are always loaded, so they're the
default; the `kortix executor` CLI is the same Executor core exposed for shell use.
