description: Daily compliance-drift check for {{projectName}}. Reads AWS resource state and audit logs across {{aws_regions}}, compares against the compliance policy stored in skills and memory, files every finding, and drafts proposed remediation as a reviewed change — never applying a fix. Load this when the daily cron fires the sweep, or a human asks for a compliance, drift, or policy check.

<skill name="compliance-sweep">

<overview>
Once a day, check `{{projectName}}`'s AWS footprint against policy before drift
accumulates into an audit problem. Each run is a **fresh session in its own
sandbox** — one sweep, one disposable machine, nothing carried over. The agent
reads AWS resource state and the audit logs with **read-only** access, checks
both against the compliance policy, files every finding to
{{alert_channel}}, and drafts remediation as a **reviewed change request** — it
never applies a fix itself.
</overview>

<when-to-load>
- The daily cron fires the compliance sweep.
- A human asks for a compliance check, a drift check, or a policy audit.
- Someone asks to add or change a rule in the compliance policy itself.
</when-to-load>

<workflow>

## Step 0 — Load the policy, fresh

This is not a ledger to resume — it's live policy, loaded fresh every run:
```sh
cat .kortix/memory/compliance-policy.md 2>/dev/null || echo "(no policy file yet — using the defaults below)"
```
If no policy file exists yet, use these starting defaults and propose creating
`.kortix/memory/compliance-policy.md` from them on this run:
- **Buckets** — none public unless explicitly allow-listed by name.
- **Tags** — every resource carries `owner` and `environment`.
- **IAM roles** — no role holds `*:*` or an unscoped `iam:PassRole`.

### Step 0b — Editing the policy on request

If a human asked to add or change a rule in the policy itself (not run a
sweep), that's the whole job for this run: read
`.kortix/memory/compliance-policy.md` (Step 0 above), edit it to reflect the
requested rule, and confirm the change back to the human. No AWS calls, no
findings, no change request — the policy file itself is the human-authored
input the rest of this skill checks against.

## Step 1 — Pull AWS resource state (read-only)

S3 buckets and IAM roles are **global, account-wide resources** — `list-buckets`
and `list-roles` return the same full set no matter which region you ask from.
List and evaluate each one exactly once per sweep, outside any region loop:
```sh
for bucket in $(aws s3api list-buckets --query 'Buckets[].Name' --output text); do
  bucket_region=$(aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket "$bucket" --query 'LocationConstraint' --output text)
  [ "$bucket_region" = "None" ] && bucket_region="us-east-1"
  aws s3api get-bucket-policy-status --bucket "$bucket" --region "$bucket_region" 2>/dev/null
  aws s3api get-bucket-tagging        --bucket "$bucket" --region "$bucket_region" 2>/dev/null
done
for role in $(aws iam list-roles --query 'Roles[].RoleName' --output text); do
  aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name "$role"
  aws iam list-role-policies          --role-name "$role"
done
```
Every call here is a read (`list-*`, `get-*`). The credentials are brokered
server-side and read-only — you use them, you never see the raw key.

{{aws_regions}} is reserved for resources that are genuinely regional. Today's
policy (Step 0) covers only buckets and roles, so nothing loops over
{{aws_regions}} in this version of the sweep. If the policy is ever extended
to a regional resource (e.g. VPCs or security groups), scope only that new
check to `$(echo "{{aws_regions}}" | tr ',' ' ')` — never re-loop the global
bucket/role checks above.

## Step 2 — Check against policy

For each resource, evaluate against the policy loaded in Step 0. Each
resource is listed exactly once (Step 1), so file **at most one finding per
resource id** — never one per region pass:

| Check | Violation condition | Finding type |
|---|---|---|
| Bucket exposure | `PolicyStatus.IsPublic = true` and the bucket isn't allow-listed | Newly public bucket |
| Tagging | Missing a required tag key from the policy | Untagged resource |
| IAM scope | Role holds `*:*` or an unscoped `iam:PassRole` | Over-broad role |

## Step 3 — Cross-reference the audit logs

For every violation from Step 2, find when it happened and who did it. Which
region(s) to query depends on the resource type:
- **Bucket finding** → query only the bucket's own region, resolved in Step 1
  (`$bucket_region`).
- **Role finding** → IAM is a global service with no owning region, so check
  each region in {{aws_regions}} in turn and stop at the first hit.
```sh
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
  --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=ResourceName,AttributeValue="<resource-id>" \
  --max-results 10 --region <region-per-rule-above>
```
Attach the event time, actor, and source IP (if present) to the finding. If
nothing turns up in any queried region within the CloudTrail retention window,
note the finding as "origin unknown — predates available audit history"
rather than guessing.

## Step 4 — Draft the proposed remediation (never apply it)

- **Bucket** → draft the tightened bucket policy / block-public-access config.
- **Tags** → draft the missing tag set from the policy.
- **Role** → draft the narrower policy (drop the offending statement or scope
  the resource/action).

Open one change request per finding via `project.cr.open` (or one per resource
group when several findings share a fix). Title it with the resource and
violation, e.g. `compliance: newly-public bucket acme-uploads`. The CR body is
the diagnosis from Step 3 (what, when, who) plus the proposed fix. A human
reviews and applies it — you stop at opening the CR.

## Step 5 — Post the summary

Post to {{alert_channel}}: one line per finding — resource, violation, when/who
changed it, and a link to its proposed CR. If nothing drifted, post one line
saying so; don't skip the post just because the sweep is clean.

<guardrails>
- **Read-only against AWS.** Every call in Step 1 and Step 3 is a read
  (`list-*`, `get-*`, `lookup-events`). Never call a `put-*`, `delete-*`, or
  `update-*` action against AWS from this skill.
- **No auto-remediation.** Every fix is a proposed, human-approved change
  request opened via `project.cr.open` — never applied directly, no exceptions
  for findings you're confident about.
- **Fresh every run.** There is no run-to-run ledger here — the only state
  carried between sweeps is the policy file itself, and that's authored by a
  human, not written by this skill.
- **Scoped, brokered secrets.** AWS access is read-only and brokered
  server-side; scoped to this agent's grant.
- **File everything the policy flags.** A finding you'd personally wave through
  still gets filed as written — this skill checks the policy, not intent.
