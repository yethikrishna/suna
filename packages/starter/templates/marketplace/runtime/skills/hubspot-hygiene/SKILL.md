description: Nightly HubSpot CRM hygiene runbook for {{projectName}}. Finds and merges duplicate contacts, fills missing fields from enrichment data, flags stale deals, and gates any bulk field update over {{bulk_update_threshold}} records behind human approval.

<skill name="hubspot-hygiene">

<overview>
Keep HubSpot clean without a person babysitting it. A nightly cron spawns a
fresh session with scoped access to HubSpot and Clearbit. Each run dedupes
contacts, fills missing fields from enrichment data, flags deals that have
gone quiet, and posts what it did. Individual field fills write directly;
a bulk fill above the threshold stops for a human before it touches the CRM.

Proactive and schedule-driven; each run is stateless — there is no local
ledger file. The one thing that spans runs is a pending bulk-update request:
its state lives in {{alert_channel}} itself (the posted draft plus any
approval reply), not in the sandbox.

<when-to-load>
- The nightly cron fires the CRM hygiene sweep.
- A human asks the agent to clean up HubSpot, dedupe contacts, or check CRM
  data quality on demand.

<workflow>

## Step 0 — Confirm access

No local state to resume — each run starts with a clean sandbox. The one
exception lives in Slack, not the sandbox: check {{alert_channel}} for an
unresolved "Pending bulk update" post from a previous run before assuming
this run's batches are new (see Step 5). Confirm the HubSpot and Clearbit
connectors are live before touching any records:

```
GET /crm/v3/objects/contacts?limit=1
GET /crm/v3/objects/deals?limit=1
```

If either connector fails, stop and report the failure in the summary
instead of running a partial sweep.

## Step 1 — Pull the working set

Pull contacts and open deals touched or created in the last 24h, plus any
contact record with a null in a required field:

```
GET /crm/v3/objects/contacts/search
  filterGroups: [{ propertyName: "lastmodifieddate", operator: "GTE", value: <24h ago> }]
GET /crm/v3/objects/contacts/search
  filterGroups: [{ propertyName: "jobtitle", operator: "NOT_HAS_PROPERTY" }, ...]
GET /crm/v3/objects/deals/search
  filterGroups: [{ propertyName: "dealstage", operator: "NEQ", value: "closedlost|closedwon" }]
```

## Step 2 — Find and merge duplicate contacts

Two contacts are the same record when they match on any of:

- Same primary email address.
- Same first + last name AND same company domain.

A duplicate is often an older, untouched record that falls outside the
Step 1 working set (not modified in the last 24h, no missing field). For
each contact in the working set, run a targeted HubSpot search against the
**full contact base** — by primary email, and separately by
(firstname + lastname + company domain) — to surface any existing match
outside the 24h window, not just duplicates among contacts already pulled
in Step 1.

For each confirmed pair:

1. Pick the primary: the record with the older `createdate`, or the one with
   more associated deals/tickets if createdate ties.
2. Merge via HubSpot's contact merge endpoint so all associations (deals,
   tickets, notes, timeline) roll onto the primary.
3. If the two records disagree on a field HubSpot can't auto-resolve (e.g.
   conflicting job titles), keep the primary's value and note the conflict
   in the summary rather than guessing.

## Step 3 — Fill missing fields from enrichment

Required fields: `jobtitle`, `industry`, `numemployees` (company size). For
each contact missing one or more:

1. Query Clearbit by email or company domain.
2. If Clearbit returns a value, write it to the missing field.
3. Batch the writes for this pass. If the batch for a single field would
   touch **more than {{bulk_update_threshold}} records**, do not write it —
   go to Step 5 instead. Fills below the threshold write immediately,
   per-record.

## Step 4 — Flag stale deals

A deal is stale when it hasn't moved stage and has had no logged activity
(email, call, note, meeting) in **21+ days**. For each match:

- Set a `hygiene_stale` custom property (or tag) to `true` with the last
  activity date.
- Never change `dealstage`, never close the deal — flagging only.

## Step 5 — Human approval gate for bulk updates

First, resolve any pending request from a previous run: search
{{alert_channel}} for the agent's own most recent "Pending bulk update:
<field>" post.

- **No pending post found, or the last one already carries this agent's own
  "Applied"/"Resolved" reply** → this field has nothing outstanding; if
  Step 3 produced a new batch over {{bulk_update_threshold}} records for it,
  go to "New batch" below.
- **A pending post exists with no resolution reply yet** → check whether an
  authorized approver (not the agent) has replied "approve"/"approved" in
  that thread:
  - **Approved** — re-verify each record in the posted sample still needs
    the fill (skip any that changed since the post), write the batch for
    that field, reply in-thread confirming exactly what was applied, then
    continue to Step 6. Do not also start a "New batch" for the same field
    this run.
  - **No approval reply yet** — do not write, and do not post a duplicate
    request for the same field. Note it as still pending in this run's
    summary (Step 6) and move on.

**New batch** — when Step 3 produces a batch over {{bulk_update_threshold}}
records for a field with no unresolved pending post:

1. Do not write any record in that batch.
2. Draft an approval request: field name, record count, and a sample of 5–10
   affected records with old → new values.
3. Post it to {{alert_channel}} as "Pending bulk update: <field>" and stop —
   do not write, do not wait inside this run. The batch is applied on a
   later run, once that run's Step 5 finds an explicit approval reply in
   this thread; never retry-write without one.

## Step 6 — Post the summary

Post one summary to {{alert_channel}} covering:

- Duplicate contacts merged (count + any unresolved conflicts).
- Fields filled from enrichment (count per field).
- Deals flagged stale (count, with links).
- Any bulk update pending approval, what it is, and why it's waiting.

</workflow>

<guardrails>
- **Bulk updates require approval.** Any single field-fill batch touching
  more than {{bulk_update_threshold}} records stops for a human before it
  writes — no exceptions.
- **No write without an explicit approval reply.** A pending bulk update is
  only applied once a run's Step 5 finds an explicit "approve"/"approved"
  reply in its thread from someone other than the agent — checked fresh at
  the start of every run. Silence is not approval.
- **One pending post per field.** Don't post a second "Pending bulk update"
  request for a field that already has one awaiting approval — resolve or
  fold it into that thread first.
- **Merge, never delete.** Duplicate resolution always merges into a primary
  record; a contact is never deleted outright.
- **Flag, never close.** Stale deals are marked for visibility; the agent
  never changes deal stage or closes a deal.
- **Scoped secrets.** HubSpot and Clearbit credentials are injected into the
  sandbox at runtime, scoped to this agent's grant.
- **No cross-run assumptions beyond the channel itself.** Each run re-derives
  duplicates, gaps, and stale deals from current HubSpot state; the only
  thing it checks from a prior run is an outstanding approval reply in
  {{alert_channel}}.
