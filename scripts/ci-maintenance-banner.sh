# ci-maintenance-banner.sh — flip the system-wide maintenance banner on/off
# around a production rollout, from CI.
#
# Called by .github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml:
#   on  <version>   activate a non-dismissible CRITICAL banner ("new version
#                   rolling out, may be briefly unavailable") at the START of the
#                   rollout, so every user sees it for the whole window.
#   off             clear it (level none) — only called AFTER the rollout is green.
#
# It writes the same dual database + Vercel Edge Config state the admin console
# uses, via `PUT /api/maintenance` on the web app.
#
# SAFETY — it never clobbers a human-set incident banner. Since the rollout banner
# is itself `critical` now, "ours" is identified by its title, not its level:
#   * `on`  refuses to override an active `critical`/`blocking` incident whose
#           title is NOT our rollout title (a real, human-set incident).
#   * `off` only clears the banner if it is STILL our rollout banner (same title
#           and `critical` level); if an admin changed it mid-rollout, we leave it.
#
# Env:
#   MAINTENANCE_TOKEN     (required) platform-admin bearer
#   MAINTENANCE_URL       (optional) full endpoint, default https://kortix.com/api/maintenance
#
# Best-effort: the caller runs this with continue-on-error so a banner hiccup
# never fails the release.
